Why are we startled when a magician saws someone in half?
It's because we don't expect there
to be jumps are separations between the top half
and the lower half of a body.
Magic tricks play with our visceral sense of continuity.
In this section, we're going to use continuity
to compute limits, and explore what continuity means
with the help of what's known as the intermediate value theorem.
