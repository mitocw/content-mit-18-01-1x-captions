All right.
Let's finish this up.
We had this rate dv dt, and we have the height.
We're modeling it as a constant 2 centimeters.
And we want dr dt when r is 250 meters.
And we also had this relationship--
V equals pi hr squared.
Both sides here we're treating as functions of t,
and they're always equal.
And so we can take d by dt on both the left and the right
and just differentiate implicitly.
When we do that on the left, we're getting dv dt.
And on the right, there's a lot of letters there,
but remember that pi and h are just constants.
So we can just pull those out and put them in front.
We'll get pi d by dt of r squared.
And that equals pi times h.
And then the derivative of r squared with respect to t
isn't just 2r.
It's 2r times dr dt because of the chain rule.
And that's the implicit differentiation right there.
So we have a rate on the right, and that's good
because this is supposed to be equal to dv dt.
So we have a rate equalling something
that's involving a rate.
That's our related rates.

Since we're done with the differentiation now,
we can just plug in.
So on the left, we've got our 2 million liters per hour
for dv dt.
And on the right, we've got pi h equals 2 centimeters.
Then there's r2, and then r, which we want to be 250 meters.
Then we have dr dt, which is the thing
that we want to solve for.
So we can just divide everything that's on the right
into the left.
We'll just have dr dt remaining on the right,
and then on the left, we've got 2 million divided by,
let's see, pi 2 times 2 times 250 is 1,000 pi.
And that's our denominator.
And then we have all of these units to deal with.
We've got liters per hour from the left,
and then we're dividing by the centimeters and the meters that
are coming from the right.
So this is a little bit of a mess,
but we can transform all of these
into common units of meters.
So the fraction is just becoming 2,000 over pi,
and then the liters are 0.001 meters cubed.
And then on the bottom, we've got hours.
And then centimeters times meters is just 0.01 meters
squared.
We're converting centimeters into meters here.
And when we work through all of this,
the number becomes 200 over pi and the meter
squared cancels the meters cubed,
and we're just getting meters per hour, which is perfect.
That's the type of units that we would
want for how fast the edge is is moving.
Using units is a really good way to make
sure you've got things right.
If you end up with units that don't make any sense,
then you probably didn't do your implicit differentiation
correctly.

In general, this is the sort of strategy
that you could follow for related rates problems.
The first thing you want to do is to draw a picture.
Then you should identify the variables and the rates
that are involved.
After that, you need to come up with an equation relating
those variables that holds for all time.
After that, you can implicitly differentiate
both sides of that equation.
And then and only then can you plug in the values
and solve for the rate that you're interested in.
Sound good?
