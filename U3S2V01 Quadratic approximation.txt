In this section, we are going to introduce
the quadratic approximation.
Whereas the linear approximation of a function at a point
is a line, the quadratic approximation
of a function at a point is a parabola.
We'll see that a quadratic approximation typically
has less error.
To keep track of the size of errors generated
by approximations, we are also going
to introduce a notation called Big O, which
is a great book keeping tool.
