Let's just take an example that you
could have done in the very first unit of this class,
the limit as x goes to 1 of x to the 10th minus 1
divided by x squared minus 1.
So that's a limit that we could have handled.
And the thing that's interesting-- I mean,
if you like, this is in this category
that we mentioned at the beginning of the course
of interesting limits.
What's interesting about it is that if you
do the silly thing, which is just plug in x equals 1,
at x equals 1, you're going to get 0 over 0.
And that's what we call an indeterminate form.

It's just unclear what it is from that plugging in.
You just can't get it.
Now, on the other hand, there's a trick for doing this.
And this is the trick that we did
at the beginning of the class.
And the idea is I can divide in the numerator and denominator
by x minus 1.
So this limit is unchanged, if I try
to cancel the hidden factor, x minus 1,
in the numerator and denominator.
Now, we can actually carry out these ratios of polynomials
and calculate them by long division.
In algebra, that's very, very long.
We want to do this with calculus, and we already have.
We already know that this ratio is what's
called a difference quotient.
And then in the limit, it tends to the derivative
of this function.
So the idea is that this is actually
equal to, in the limit-- let's just study one piece of it.
So if I have a function f of x, which is x to the 10th minus 1,
and the value at 1 happens to be equal to 0, then
this expression that we have, which is in disguise this--
this is in disguise the difference quotient-- tends
to as x goes to 1 the derivative, which
is f prime of 1.
That's what it is.
So we know what the numerator goes to.
And similarly, we'll know what the denominator goes to.

But what is that?
Well, f prime of x is equal to 10 x to the ninth power.
So we know what the answer is.
In the numerator, it's 10 x to the ninth.
In the denominator, it's going to be
2x-- that's the derivative of x squared minus 1.
And then we're going to have to evaluate that at x equals 1.
And so it's going to be 10/2, which is 5.
So the answer is 5.
And it's pretty easy to get from our techniques and knowledge
of derivatives using this rather clever algebraic trick--
this business of dividing by x minus 1.

What I want to do now is just carry this method out
systematically.
And that's going to give us the approach
to what's known as L'Hopital's rule,
my main subject for today.
So here's the idea.
Suppose we're considering in general a limit
as x goes to some number a of f of x divided by g of x.
And suppose it's the bad case, where we can't decide.
So it's indeterminate, f of a is equal to g of a is equal to 0.
So it would be 0/0.
Now, we're just going to do exactly the same thing
we did over here.
Namely, we're going to divide a numerator and denominator.
And we're going to repeat that argument.
So we have here f of x divided by x minus a and g of x divided
by x minus a also.
I haven't changed anything yet.
And now, I'm going to write it in this suggestive form.
Namely, I'm going to take separately the limit
in the numerator and the denominator,
and I'm going to make one more shift.
So I'm going to take the limit as x
goes to a in the numerator, but I'm
going to write it as f of x minus f of a divided by x minus
a.
So that's the way I'm going to write the numerator.
And then I've got to draw a much longer line here.
So why am I allowed to do that?
That's because f of a is 0.
So I didn't change this numerator
of the numerator any by subtracting that. f of a
is equal to 0.

And I'll do the same thing in the denominator.

Again, g of a is 0, so this is OK.
And lo and behold, I know what these limits are.
This is f prime of a divided by g prime of a.

So that's it.
That's the technique.
And this evaluates the limit, and it's not so difficult.
The formula is pretty straightforward here.
And it works provided that g prime of a is not 0.
