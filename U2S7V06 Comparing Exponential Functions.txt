Here's the graph of the function y equals 2 to the x.
And you've use this Mathlet before to approximate the value
of the derivative at x equals 0, which you found
to be something close to 0.695.
This, of course, is just an approximation.
Then we want to compare this value
to the value of the derivative of another exponential
function.
The exponential function we are looking at is 4 to the x.
So what's the graph of 4 to the x going to look like?
Well, it's going to go through the point 0, 1.
And it's going to be a bit steeper, because at 1, it's
going to be equal to 4, and at negative 1,
it's going to be equal to 1/4.
So the graph is going to look something like this.
So we definitely expect that the derivative at x equals 0
is going to be larger.
So let's go ahead and change this function to the function 4
to the x and find its derivative.
So we see here that it's definitely steeper,
and we get a value to be somewhere around 1.39.
Of course, again, this is just an approximation.
So let's get rid of the Mathlet and write some of this down.
So this is what we just saw.
We saw that the derivative of 2 to the x at x equals 0
was approximately equal to 0.695,
and the derivative of 4 to the x at x equals 0
was approximately equal to 1.39.
Remember that this is this mystery number M of 2,
and this is the mystery number M of 4.
And recall that the definition of the derivative
of an exponential function, a to the x,
is given by M of a times a to x.
So we're really interested in what this mystery number M of a
is.
Of course, we aren't really able to compute these,
and what we have are just sort of numerical approximations.
They're definitely not exact, so what we're going to do
is that we are going to make a definition.
We are going to define the base e,
to be the unique real number so that M of e is equal to 1.
Notice that we're not seeing what the number e is,
but from the numeric computations we've done,
it's very suggestive that e is greater than 2 and less than 4.
So I'm not going to tell you what e is right now,
but I am saying that it exists.
So why am I defining this number e?
What does this buy us?
Well, let's think about the function e to the x.
What is the derivative of this function?
Well, our formula from before tells us
that this is equal to M of e times e to the x.
But wait a second.
M of e is equal to 1, so the derivative of e to the x
is e to the x.
I'm going to put a big box around this,
because this is a big important formula in this class.
It seems really easy, but this is really powerful.
And it's going to get us pretty far.
So you notice that we still haven't really
answered the question what is M of a,
and we're not going to do that yet.
But I'm going to let you practice using
the derivative of e to the x.
And then we'll go ahead and give a deeper argument
to explain why it is that we know
this number, e, has to exist.
And after that, when we introduce the logarithm,
we'll finally answer this question and find M of a.
