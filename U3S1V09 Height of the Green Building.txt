Here we are standing in front of the green building, the tallest
building on MIT's campus.
And we're going to measure its height using this protractor
device and this rope, which we know from the company measures
50 feet in length.
So we're going to use this rope to measure
the distance we're standing away from the green building.
Let's get started.

OK.
So I'm going to start from the base of the building
where we measured our distance from
and go all the way until I have the very top of the building
in the center of my sight.
There we go.
All right.
And the protractor is reading about 33 degrees.
So that's an angle of 57 degrees.
Awesome.
OK.
So we measure that we were 175 feet from the building
and I'm about five feet tall.
Minus a few inches.
Minus a few inches from my eyeball.
OK.
Let's go to estimate the height of the green building.
OK.
