OK.
So here's the situation.
We have a problem.
And we've hung a string, right?
And it went down like this.
And then it went like that.
All right?
And we discovered where it settled physically.
So we want to explain this mathematically, and see what's
going on with this problem.
So this is a real-life problem.
It honestly is a problem you have
to solve if you want to build a bridge, like a suspension
bridge.
This, among many problems.
It's a very serious and important problem.
And this is the simplest one of this type.
All right?
So we've got our shape here.
This should be a straight line, maybe not quite as angled
as that.
So now, we've already drawn the diagram,
and we've more or less visualized
what's going on here.
But the first step after the diagram is to give letters,
is to label things appropriately.
And I do not expect you to be able to do this at this stage,
because it requires a lot of experience.
But I'm going to do it for you.
All right?
We're going to just do that.
So the simplest thing to do is to use
the coordinates of the plane.
And if you do that, it's also easiest to use the origin.
My favorite number is 0, and it should be yours, too.
So we're going to make this point be 0, 0.
Now, there's another fixed point in this problem.
And it's this point over here.
And we don't know what its coordinates are,
so we're just going to give them letters, A and B.
But those letters are going to be
fixed numbers in this problem.
And we want to solve it for all possible A's and B's.
Now, the interesting thing, remember,
is what happens when B is not 0?
If B is equal to 0, we already have
a clue that the point should be the center point.
It should be exactly that x, the middle point,
which I'm going to label in a second, is halfway in between.
So now, the variable point that I'm going to use is down here.
I'm going to call this point x, y.
So here's my setup.
I've now given labels to all the things on the diagram so far--
most of the things on the diagram.

All right.
So now, what else do I have to do?
Well, I have to explain to you that this is a minimization
problem.
What happens, actually, physically,
is that the weight settles to the lowest point.
That's the thing that has the lowest potential energy.
So we're minimizing a function.
And it's this curve here.
The constraint is that we are restricted to this curve.
So this is a constraint curve.
And we want the lowest point of this curve.

So now, we need a little bit more language in order
to describe what it is that we've got.
And the constraint curve, we got it in a particular way--
namely, we strung some string from here to there.
And what happens at all of these points
is that the total length of the string is the same.
So one way of expressing the constraint
is that the length of the string is constant.
And so in order to figure out what the constraint is,
what this curve is, I have to describe that analytically.
And I'm going to do that by drawing in some helping lines--
namely, some right triangles-- to figure out
what this length is and what the other length is.
So this length is pretty easy if I draw a right triangle here,
because we go over x and we go down y.
So this length is the square root
of x squared plus y squared.
Right?
That's the Pythagorean theorem.
Similarly, over here, I'm going to get another length, which
is a little bit of a mess.
It's the vertical-- I'm just going to label one half of it
so that you see.
So this horizontal distance is x.
And this horizontal distance from this top point
with this right angle over there, it starts at x and ends
at A. The rightmost point is A in the x-coordinate.
So the whole distance is A minus x.
All right?
So that's this leg of this right triangle.
And similarly, the vertical distance will be B minus y.
And so the formula here-- which is a little complicated--
for this length, is the square root
of A minus x squared plus B minus y squared.
So here are the two formulas that
are going to allow me to set up my problem now.
So my goal is to set it up the way I did here, just
with formulas, and not with diagrams, and not with names.

OK.
So here's what I'd like to do.
I claim that what's constrained, if I'm along that curve,
is that the total length is constant.
So that's this statement here.
The square root of x squared plus y squared
plus this other square root-- these are the two
lengths of string-- is equal to some number
L, which is constant.

And this, as I said, is what I'm calling my constraint.

Yeah?
[INAUDIBLE]

So the question is, shouldn't it be B plus y?
No.
And the reason is that y is a negative number.
It's below 0.
So it's actually the sum.
Minus y is a positive number.

All right.
So here's the formula.
And then, we want to find the minimum of something.
So what is that we're finding the minimum of?
This is actually the hardest part of the problem,
conceptually.
I've tried to repair it, but it's very hard
to figure this out.
We're finding the least what?
It's y.

Just got a name for that.
So we want to find the lowest y.

Now, the reason why it seems a little weird
is you might think of y as just being a variable.
But really y is a function.
It's really y equals y of x is defined implicitly
by the constraint equation.
That's what that curve is.
And notice the bottom point is exactly
the place where the tangent line will be horizontal,
which is just what we want.
So from the diagram, bottom point
is where y prime is equal to 0.
So this is the critical point.

Yeah?
[INAUDIBLE] if you had the environment
that the slope is [INAUDIBLE], you
could still have [INAUDIBLE] that [INAUDIBLE]
taking y prime equal to 0, right?
Exactly.
So I'm deriving for you-- so the question
is, could I have just tried to find
y prime equals 0 to begin with?
The answer is yes, absolutely.
And, in fact, I'm leading in that direction.
I'm just showing you.
So I'm trying to make the following very subtle point,
which is in maximum minimum problems,
we always have to keep track of two things.
Often, the interesting point is the critical point.
And that, indeed, turns out to be the case here.
But we always have to check the ends.
And so there are several ways of checking the ends.
One is we did this physical problem.
We can see that's coming up here.
We can see that's coming up here.
Therefore, the bottom must be at this critical point.
So that's OK.
So that's one way of checking it.
Another way of checking it is the reasoning that I just gave.
But it's really the same reasoning.
I'm pointing to this thing, and I'm showing you
that the bottom is somewhere in the middle,
so, therefore, it is a place of horizontal tangency.
That's the reasoning that I'm using.
So again, this is to avoid having
to evaluate a limit of an and, or to use
the second derivative test, which
is a total catastrophe in this case.
All right?

OK.
Now, there's one other thing that you might know about
if you've seen this geometric construction
before with a string and chalk, which
is this curve is an ellipse.
It turns out this is a piece of an ellipse.
It's a huge ellipse.
These two points turn out to be the so-called foci
of the ellipse.
However, that geometric fact is totally useless for solving
this problem.
Completely useless.
If you actually write out the formulas for the ellipse,
you'll discover that you have a much harder problem
on your hands, and it will take you twice or 10 times as long.
So it's true that it's an ellipse.
But it doesn't help.
OK?
So what we're going to do instead is much simpler.
We're going to leave this expression alone.
And we're just going to differentiate implicitly.
So again, we use implicit differentiation
on the constraint equation.
So that's the equation which is directly above me there,
at the top.
And I have to differentiate it with respect to x.
So that's a little ugly.
But we've done this a few times before.
When you differentiate a square root,
the square root goes into the denominator.

And there's a factor of 1/2, so there's a 2x which cancels.
So I claim it's this.
Now, because y depends on x, there's also a y y prime here.
So technically speaking, it's twice this with 1/2.
2 over 2 times that.
So that's the differentiation of the first piece of this guy.

Now, I'm going to do the second one.
And it's also the chain rule.
But you're just going to have to let me do it for you,
because it's just a little bit too long for you
to pay attention to.
It turns out there's a minus sign that
comes out, because there's a minus x and a minus y there.
And then the numerator, the denominator
is the same massive square root.
So it's A minus x squared B minus y squared.
And the numerator is A minus x, which
is what replaces the x over here,
and then another term, which is B minus y times y prime.
I claim that that's analogous to what I did in the first term.
And you'll just have to check this on your own.
All right?
Because I did it too fast for you to be able check yourself.
Now, that's going to be equal to what on the right-hand side?
What's the derivative of L with respect so x.
0.
It's 0.
It's not changing in the problem.
Although my parachute stuff stretches,
we tried to stretch it to its fullest extent
so that we kept it fixed.
That was the goal here.
So now, this looks like a total mess.
But it's not.
And let me show you why.
It simplifies a great deal.
And let me show you exactly how.
So first of all, the whole point is we're looking for the place
where y prime is 0.
So that means that these terms go away.
Y prime is equal to 0.

So they're gone.
And now, what we have is the following equation.
It's x divided by square root of x squared plus y squared is
equal to-- if I put it on the other side,
the minus sign is changed to a plus sign.
A minus x divided by this other massive object.
A minus x squared plus b minus y squared.

So this is what it simplifies to.
Now, again, that also might look complicated to you.
But I claim that this is something.
This is a kind of equilibrium equation
that can be interpreted geometrically
in a way that is very meaningful and important.
So first of all, let me observe for you that this x is
something on our picture.
And the square root of x squared plus y squared
is something on our picture.
Namely, if I go over to the picture, here was x.
And this was a right triangle.
And this hypotenuse was square root
of x squared plus y squared.
So if I call this angle alpha, then this is the sine of alpha.
It's a right triangle.
That's the opposite leg.
So this guy is the sine of alpha.

Similarly, the other side has an interpretation
for the other right triangle.
If this angle is beta, then the opposite side is A minus x.
And the hypotenuse is what was in the denominator over there.
So this side is sine of beta.

And so what this condition is telling us
is that alpha is equal to beta, which is the hidden
symmetry in the problem.
I don't know if you can actually see it
when I show you this thing.
But no matter how I tilt it, actually,
the two angles from the horizontal are the same.

In the middle it's kind of obvious
that that should be the case.
But on the sides, it's not obvious
that that's what's happening.
So that's a symmetry, if you like, of the situation.
These two angles are equal.
But there's something more to be said.
If you do a force diagram for this, what you'll discover
is that the tension on the two lines
is the same, which means when you build something
which is hanging like this, it will involve the least stress.
If you hang something very heavy,
and one side carries twice as much load is the other,
then you have twice as much chance of its falling
and breaking.
If they each hold the same strength,
then you've distributed the load in a much more balanced way.
So this is a balance condition.
And it's very typical of minimization problems.
And fortunately, there are nice solutions
which distribute the weight reasonably well.
And that's certainly the principle
of suspension bridges.
