Mathematics is a language.
So the notations we use are very important.
There are two standard notations used to describe derivatives.
You've already been introduced to one, prime notation.
Which was developed by Newton.
The second one is called Liebniz Notation.
Introduced by-- spoiler alert-- Leibniz.
Mathematicians, scientists, and engineers
find both notations very useful.
So we will give you ample opportunity
to get you comfortable with both.
