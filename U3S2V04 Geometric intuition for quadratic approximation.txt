In this section, we're going to introduce
the quadratic approximation.
To get started, I want to explain the geometric intuition
for what the quadratic approximation really is.
Let's look at the function cosine x, near x equals 0.
First I want to remind you what the linear approximation means
geometrically.
The linear approximation near x equals 0
is the tangent line, which is this horizontal line.
And a good way to think about the linear approximation
is as the best fit line to the function at x equals 0.
What do I mean by best fit?
If I let L of x denote this tangent line, then best fit
means that the value of the tangent line and the value
of the function are equal at 0.
So L of 0 is equal to f of 0.
And the value of the derivative of the tangent line
is equal to the derivative of the function at x equals 0.
So L prime of 0 is equal to f prime of 0.
However, this particular approximation
doesn't give us a lot of information
about cosine near 0.
I can't tell from the tangent line alone
whether or not the function is curving
up away from this tangent line or down below it.
So we'd like to add some information about the curvature
or the second derivative of our function to our approximation.
And this is the idea of the quadratic approximation.
The quadratic approximation is the best fit quadratic function
or best fit parabola.
In this example, with cosine of x,
the best fit parabola is given by the function
p of x is equal to 1 minus x squared over 2.
This is the best fit parabola at x
equals 0, because the value of the quadratic and the function
should agree at 0.
The value of the first derivative
of the quadratic and the function should agree at 0.
And the value of the second derivatives should agree at 0.

Rather than give you the formula for finding
quadratic approximations immediately,
I'm going to have you just work through some problems that
helps you discover what this formula should be on your own,
because it's actually not that tricky.
But there is a constant involved that might
seem a little bit weird if you don't
know where it's coming from.
After that, we'll get a bunch of practice
finding quadratic approximations.
