You've just computed some linear approximations
near x equals 0 for all of these basic functions
that we know how to differentiate,
and we want to determine how to use these basic approximations
to easily find approximations of more complicated functions.
So for my first example, I'm going to call Example 0,
we are just going to consider some linear approximations
near the point x equals 0.
For example, suppose I'm interested in the sum
sine of x plus log of 1 plus x near x equals 0.
To find the linear approximation of this sum
I just take the sum of the linear approximations.
From this table we see that sine x is approximately x near 0,
and log of 1 plus x it is also approximately equal to x
near 0, so the sum is approximately
equal to 2x near x equals 0.
Similarly, I could multiply any of these basic functions
by a constant.
For example, 3 times e to the x, this
is going to multiply the linear approximation by a constant.
So near x equals 0, 3 times e to the x
is approximately equal to 3 times the quantity 1 plus x.

In the next examples, I want to consider
how we can build more complicated functions out
of these basic functions using composition.
You've actually already seen this used in practice when
we did the zip line example.
There we had a function of the form of 1 plus ax to the 1/2,
and we substituted ax by another variable u,
and we noted that when x is near 0, u is also near 0.
So we can take the standard approximation,
and we get that this is approximately
equal to 1 plus u/2.
Then we just substituted back in for x,
and we saw that this was 1 plus ax/2.

In this example, the composed function
was just a linear scaling factor,
but this approach actually works in general.
So let's work through a couple examples.
Example 1-- let's find a linear approximation for a log
u near the point u equals 1.

So I'm going to make a substitution,
and I'm going to set u equal to 1 plus x.
Then log of u is equal to log of 1 plus x.
Notice that when u is near 1, x is near 0,
so I can use the basic approximation log of 1 plus x
is approximately x near 0.
Substituting back in u for for x,
we get that this is approximately equal
to u minus 1.
Of course, we could have computed this approximation
directly.
To find that log of u is approximately equal
to log of 1 plus log prime of 1 times u minus 1 near u
equals 1.
Log of is equal to 0, and log prime of 1
is 1 over u evaluated at 1, which is 1.
So we get u minus 1, which is the same thing.

Let's consider another example.
This is Example 2.
We'll look at the function 4 plus sine x to the 3/2 power.
First, we need to get this in standard form,
so I'm going to pull out the 4 to get 4
to the 3/2 times the quantity 1 plus 1/4 sine
x raised to the 3/2 power.
Now I'm going to substitute u equal to sine x/4,
and we can see that when x is near 0, u is also near 0,
so we can apply a basic approximation here.
So 4 plus sine x to the 3/2 is equal to 8 times 1 plus u
to the 3/2, which is approximately equal to 8
times the quantity 1 plus 3/2u.

Substituting sine x/4 for u, we see
that this is equal to 8 times the quantity 1
plus 3/2 sine x/4.

And now I'm going to just take a linear approximation
for sine x here, which is just x near x equals 0.
So this is approximately equal to 8 times the quantity 1
plus 3/8 x.

I just want to do one more example.
Because in all the examples that I've done so far,
I've used a linear approximation,
and I've ended up with a linear function.
Consider the function 1 plus x squared to the negative 1.
So I can make a substitution u is equal to x squared,
because when x is near 0, u is also near 0.
So I can just plug in a basic approximation here.
1 plus x squared to the negative 1
is equal to 1 plus u to the negative 1,
which is approximately equal to 1 minus u.
Substituting back in for x, this is equal to 1 minus x squared.
So the key tool here was a linear approximation,
but the function that I get is not actually linear.
That's because a linear approximation for x squared
is the zero function, the constant function at 0.
But we don't want to lose that much information
when we take our approximation.
So we take approximations where appropriate, but when
we can't take an approximation of a function
without getting 0, that's as far as we'll go.
After you get some practice taking approximations
of composed functions, we'll see another real world example,
where we're interested in finding an approximation
of a composed function.
