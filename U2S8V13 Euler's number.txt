So the next thing that I'd like to do
is another fairly tricky example,
and this one is not strictly speaking within calculus,
although we're going to use the tools that we just
described to carry it out.
In fact, it will use some calculus in the very end.
And what I'm going to do is I'm going
to evaluate the limit as n goes to infinity of 1 plus 1
over n to the power n.

So now, the reason why I want to discuss this is it
turns out to have a very interesting answer,
and it's a problem that you can approach exactly
by this method, and the reason is
that it has a moving exponent.
The exponent n here is changing, and so
if you want to keep track of that a good way to do
that is to use logarithms.
So in order to figure out this limit, what we're going to do
is we're going to take the log of it
and figure out what the limit of the log
is instead of the log of the limit.
Those will be the same thing.
So we're going to take the natural log of this quantity
here.

And that's, n log 1 plus 1 over n.

And now, I'm going to rewrite this in a form which
will make it more recognizable.
So what I'd like to do is I'm going to write n--
or maybe I should say it this way,
delta x is equal to 1 over n.
So if n is going to infinity, then this delta x
is going to be going to zero.

So this is more familiar territory for us, in this class
anyway.
So let's rewrite it.
So here we have 1 over delta x, and then that is multiplied
by log of 1 plus delta x.
So n is the reciprocal of delta x.
Now, I want to change this in a very, very minor way.
I'm going to subtract 0 from it, so that's the same thing.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to subtract log of 1
from it.
That's just equal to zero.
So this is not a problem, and I'll put some parentheses
around this.

Now, you're supposed to recognize all of a sudden
what pattern this fits into.
This is the thing which we need to calculate in order
to calculate the derivative of the log function.

So this is in the limit, as delta x goes to zero,
equal to the derivative of log x.
Where?
Well, the base point is x equals 1, that's
where we're evaluating it.
That's the x_0.
That's the base value.
This is the difference quotient.
That's exactly what it is.
And so this, by definition, tends to this limit here.
But we know what the derivative of the log function is.
The derivative of the log function
is 1 over x, so this limit is 1.

So we got it.
We got the limit, and now we just
have to work backwards to figure out what this limit that we've
got over here is.

So let's do that.
So let's see here.
The log approached 1, so the limit as n
goes to infinity of 1 plus 1 over n to the n--
so sorry, the log of this.
Yeah, let's write it this way.
So this is the same thing as, well,
the thing that we know is the log of this, 1
plus 1 over n to the n.
n goes to infinity.
That's the one that we just figured out,
but now this thing is the exponential of that.
So it's really e to this power here.
So this guy is the same as the limit
of the log of a limit of this thing, which
is the same as the log of the limit.
The limit of the log and the log of the limit are the same.

Log lim equals lim log.

So I take the logarithm, I take the exponential, that
just undoes what I did before.
And so this limit is just 1, so this is e to the 1,
and so this limit that we want here is equal to e.

So I claim that with this step we've actually
closed the loop finally.
Because we have an honest numerical way to calculate e.
The first, there are many such.
But this one is a perfectly honest numerical way
to calculate e.
We had this e.
We didn't know exactly what it was.
It was this m of e, there was m of a, the logarithm,
and so on, we have all that stuff,
but we really need to nail down what this number e is.
And this is telling us, if you take, for example,
1 plus 1 over 100 to the hundredth power, that's
going to be a very good, perfectly decent anyway,
approximation to e, so this is a numerical approximation, which
is all we can ever do with this kind of irrational number.
And so that closes the loop, and we now
have a coherent family of functions,
which are actually well defined and for which we have
practical methods to calculate.
OK, so see you next time.
