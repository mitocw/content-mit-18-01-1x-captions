We're going to show you how to make your own altitude
measuring device.
To do this, we're going to need a protractor, a straw,
a piece of string, something heavy, and tape.
I'm going to go ahead and speed up the rest of this video
while I make the device, but you're going to get the idea.
First, I'm going to tie the piece of string
on to the protractor at the point on the protractor
where you measure angles from.

I'm trying to tie a secure knot, but you
notice that the string is still sliding around quite a bit.
So I'm going to grab a piece of tape
to reinforce it, and hold the string at the exact position
that I want it.
That looks pretty good, so that should do it.
Next, I tie my heavy object on to the other end of the string,
making sure that there's enough slack in the string
that the object hangs down, and you can use the string easily
to measure angles.
If the string is too long, it's going to get in the way.
If it's too short, it's going to be really difficult to measure
angles accurately.

This length will work, so I'll go ahead and tie a secure knot
on the end.

Next, we'll attach the straw as a sighting device.
So I'm going to tape it along the edge of the protractor,
right along the line that you use as a guide for measuring
angles.
Once you have it positioned where you want it,
add some more tape to help hold it in place,
and keep the straw level.
Finally, I'm just going to add a little more tape to hold down
the string as extra support.
And we're done.
Now you know how to make your own altimeter.
I'd be interested to hear how accurately you
can measure angles, and where the greatest
amount of error in your measurements is coming from.
Good luck, and have fun.
