OK.
We've got our prison yard, and here's our spotlight beam,
and it's moving around like so.
Obviously, it keeps going, but I'm
going to stop it here so that we can draw a diagram.
We've got this right triangle, and we called this x.
This side here is y, and then z is along the beam.
And then this angle is theta.

What we were given-- we know that the spotlight is rotating
at two revolutions per minute, and that's
telling us about how fast the angle in the middle
is changing.
So that's d theta dt.
But if you remember when we discussed derivatives
of trig functions, those results only
work when our angles are measured in radians.
So what we're going to have to do
is translate this revolutions per minute
into radians per minute.
And 2 revolutions is equivalent to 4 pi radians.
So 4 pi radians per minute, that's
what we'll be using for d theta dt.
And now what do we want?
We have a few choices here.
There's x, there's y, and there's z.
But x-- if you think about it, x never changes.
It's always 1/2 of the side of the square, so it's 200.
In fact, I'm just going to erase x and write 200 just
so it doesn't bother us again.
What about z?
As the beam rotates, it is true that the length of the beam
changes as well.
But that's not really what we care about.
We're interested in this spot where the beam hits the wall--
and in particular, how fast the spot moves up along the wall.
And that is going to be measured by dy dt.

OK.
Well, we've got our given rate-- d theta dt.
We know what we wany-- dy dt.
Now we need an equation that links the two.
And we can get that just from our right triangle
and trigonometry.
We don't know anything about z, but just the y and the 200
are enough.
y is the opposite leg from theta.
200 is the adjacent leg.
So y over 200 equals tangent theta.
And I'm actually going to rewrite
that as y equals 200 tan theta, because now when we implicitly
differentiate and take d by dt on both sides, on the left,
we have dy dt, which is exactly what we want.
On the right, the derivative of 200 tan theta
would be 200 secant squared theta
if we were taking the derivative with respect to theta.
And that would be measured in meters per radian.
But since we're actually taking a derivative with respect to t,
we also need a factor of d theta dt.

Plugging in now 4 pi radians per minute for d theta dt.
If we multiply that by the 200 secant
squared theta meters per radian, then
we get 800 pi secant squared theta meters per minute
as the velocity of the spot.

OK.
Now we have to figure out the maximum velocity that we
might possibly get out of this.
If we look at the picture, theta can
be anywhere from down here in this corner to up here.
So theta is between minus pi over 4 and pi over 4.
Now, you could find the maximum by taking derivatives
and checking critical points, et cetera, et cetera.
But this is really a pretty simple function.
The graph of secant is like this.
It equals 1 at theta equals 0, and then it
goes up to either side with asymptotes
at plus or minus pi over 2.
And the allowable interval is just here from minus pi over 4
to pi over 4.
So the maximum on that is at the endpoints.
So that's at plus or minus pi over 4,
and that's when the beam is hitting the corners.
And the secant of plus or minus pi over 4
is the square root of 2.
So when theta is plus or minus pi over 4,
this velocity is 800 pi, and the secant squared is then 2.
So we get 1,600 pi meters per minute.
If you want that in more familiar units,
we can change this to meters per second just by dividing by 60.
So this becomes 160 over 6 times pi meters per second.
And that's over 80 meters per second.
So I really don't think this escape plan is going to work.
Have you thought about a helicopter instead?
