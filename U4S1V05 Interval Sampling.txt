OK.
Let's say we have a continuous function f
and we found all of its critical points.
It's really important for this video
that we have all the critical points.
And you'll see why in a little bit.
We're also going to assume that f
prime is continuous at all points where it's defined.
That's generally the case for all the functions
that we're going to be dealing with in this course.
Now, in the problem that you thought about,
we had 0, 4, and 8 as the only critical points,
and let me put those on our number line,
and then, we said that f prime of 6 was positive.
But, from this set up we actually get information
about other points.
We know that the only places where f prime is 0 or is
undefined are 0, 4 and 8.
So, those are the only places where f
prime might switch sign.
It can't just jump over 0 without hitting 0
because it's continuous.
We're kind of using the intermediate value
theorem here.
So since f prime is positive at 6,
it has to stay positive during the entire stretch from 4 to 8
because 4 and 8 are the closest places where f
prime might change to negative.

Notice that I said might.
Just because f prime hits 0 or is undefined at x equals 4
does not necessarily mean it becomes negative
when x becomes less than 4.
If we wanted to know what happens,
well, we can pick a point in this interval from 0 to 4
where we can sample f prime.
Maybe we choose 3 and calculate f prime of 3 and it's positive.
So, then we would know that f prime is positive everywhere
in this interval.
And we can do the same thing for the remaining intervals.
Maybe we sample f prime of minus 1 and it's negative.
So everywhere from 0 to minus infinity, f prime is negative,
and then over here maybe we sample f prime of 10
and it's negative.
So f prime would be negative all the way from 8 to plus
infinity.
This is pretty cool.
We've only sampled 4 values of f prime,
but we've figured out the sign of f prime everywhere.
This technique of interval sampling works really well,
provided that we know all of the values where f prime is 0
or does not exist.
Those were the points that divided the number line up
into intervals in the first place.
This gets us a lot of information about f.
We know exactly where f is decreasing and increasing.
It'll decrease at first and then at x
equals 0 it hits a critical point.
Whether that's because f prime equals 0 or f prime
doesn't exist.
We don't know.
Maybe f prime is 0 equals 0.
So we get, a horizontal tangent and, then from 0 to 4
f starts increasing.
At x equals 4 we have another critical point.
Maybe it's another horizontal tangent, but then from 4 to 8
it's again increasing.
At x equals 8 is our last critical point.
And maybe I'll draw a corner this time
and f is decreasing after that forever.

So you can see, that sampling just 4 values of f prime
got us all of the Ups and Downs of f.
Not bad eh.
