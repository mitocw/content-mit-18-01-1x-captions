Hi, Welcome back to recitation.
In lecture, you've been doing related rates problems.
I've got another example for you here.
So this one's a really tricky so I'm
going to give you some time to work on it.
But I really think you should really try and work
through this one yourself.
It'll be well worth your effort.
So we've got here, OK so this is a mouthful.
We've got a 20 foot long ladder.
And it's leaning against a 12 foot wall.
But it's leaning over the wall so five feet of the ladder
project over the top of the wall.
And then the bottom of the ladder
is being pulled away from the wall at 5 feet per second.
So the question is, while this is going on,
how quickly is the top of the ladder going downwards?
How quickly is it approaching the ground?
So why don't you take a few minutes, maybe more than a few
for this one, took me a while to work it out the first time.
Take a few minutes, work this one out, come back
and we'll see how it went.

All right so hopefully you've had some luck working out
this problem on your own now.
Let's work it out together.
So this is a sort of classic, really tricky related rates
problem in that there's a lot of geometric work
that you have to do at the beginning
in order to get this right.
And then once you get the geometry down,
the calculus is basically totally
straightforward, you know you need a couple of derivatives,
you use the chain rule once, whatever.
OK so let's start off by trying and drawing a careful picture,
and then we'll have to figure out what
the quantities that we're interested in are,
and the relationships between them.
So we have here, here's the ground,
and we have a 12 foot wall.

And we have a 20 foot ladder leaning against the wall
and extending over it.
So a ladder.

Here's my ladder.

Here's my wall.
All right.
And this, the bottom of the ladder here,
is what's getting pulled away from the wall at 5 units
per second, 5 feet per second.
So 5 feet per second is how fast that's going.
And we're interested, while you do that, the ladder is
changing positions.
So the question is how fast is the top
of the ladder descending.
So you know it might also be moving in some other direction,
but we're just interested in how quickly it's going straight
down.
So first, let's talk about the things that don't change.
The height of this wall is not changing,
the wall is staying put the whole time,
and the length of the ladder is not changing.
That's staying put as well.
So those are the fixed quantities in this problem.
Basically everything else is changing.
So for example, this distance between the base of the wall
and the base of the ladder, that's
changing because the ladder's being pulled away
from the wall.
So we can give that a name.
Let's call that, that's a horizontal distance.
So we can call it x say.
And the height of the top of the ladder is changing.
So let's draw that in.
And that's what we're interested in,
is the height, so we can call it y.
And let's see what else.
Well OK, so the whole ladder isn't changing in length,
but as this gets pulled, this top point
is sort of sliding down toward the wall,
the amount of the ladder that extends over the wall
is changing.
So I guess we could choose.
We could give this a variable name,
or we could give this part a variable name.
I think I'm going to give the little one a variable name,
call it d for distance I guess.
And OK, so if this is d because the whole ladder has length 20,
we have that this part, this segment, has length 20 minus d.
OK so I think that those quantities describe
all the possible lengths of interest in this picture.
So now, OK so that's just the first,
the set up, right so that's the first thing that has to happen.
Now after we set up, we need to figure out
what the relationships between these different variables are.
So, well let's see, what have we got?
Well one thing we've got is that we've
got a right triangle here.
So the wall, and the ground, and the ladder, those three
segments form a right triangle.
So we can apply the Pythagorean theorem here.
So that's one relationship we have,
and that's going to give us a relationship between x
and 20 minus d.
So that'll give us a relationship between x and d.
So this Pythagorean theorem, OK so
what does the Pythagorean theorem say?
So by the Pythagorean theorem, we
have x squared plus that's a 1, 12 squared, is equal
to the quantity 20 minus d squared.
So that's one identity that we have, identity we have,
that relates these three quantities.
So that's good, because we know how fast x is changing,
and so with this identity, that means
we can use related rates to figure out
how fast d is changing as well.
So that's good, that will be a step in the right direction.
But what we actually need to know is how fast y is changing.
So, right, because that's what the question is asking for,
how quickly is the top of the ladder approaching the So how
what's the rate of change in y with respect to time?
So I need another identity here in order
to figure out what the relationship with y is
and these other variables, and there
are a couple of different ways to go about this.
I think the one that I'm going to do,
so there is another right triangle here.
So you could, if you wanted to name this segment as well,
then you could do another right triangle.
But then you'd need a third relationship
relating this segment to d or something like that.
So I'm not going to go that route.
But I'm going to go do something related
to that, which is that this bigger right triangle, which
has this the height of the top of the ladder from the ground,
and the whole length of the ladder is two of its sides
and a piece of the ground.
So that bigger right triangle is similar to this smaller right
triangle.
Right, I mean they have right triangles
and they have the same base angle there.
So they're similar triangles.
So by similar triangles, now I have
to remember all my geometry right,
so the ratio of corresponding sides are equal.
So in this case, the ratio of the hypotenuses
is equal to the ratio of these legs.
And that'll relate so the hypotenuse is involved
d, and the vertical legs, well one of them is just constant,
and one of them involves y.
So that'll set up a relationship between d and y.
And so then I have x linked to d, and I'll have d linked to y,
and so then we can use related rates
to figure out what the relationship between y and x
is, and figure out the thing we're after,
which is the rate of change in y.
So I haven't actually written anything down yet.
So what is the similar triangle.
So here, let's look at the hypotenuses,
so the big hypotenuse has length 20,
and a small hypotenuse has length 20 minus d, good.
So that's the ratio of the hypotenuses,
and so that has to be equal to the ratio
of the corresponding legs, and so the big leg is y,
and the small leg is 12.
OK.
So there is Pythagorean theorem, there's similar triangles.
So we now have the relationships that we're
after relating x and y and d all to each other.
Great, so now we can do the calculus part of this problem .
So now we know--
I guess we actually we need a few more things, take it back.
So now we need the condition, we're after this at a moment,
at a particular moment in time.
And at our particular moment in time,
so I haven't used this one given yet, that 5 feet of the wall,
sorry, 5 feet of the ladder projects over the wall.
So OK so at our moment.
So at the key moment, we have the d is equal to 5.
OK so that means 20 minus d is equal to 15.

What does that mean?
So that means that at that moment,
x in this right triangle is the third leg in a right triangle
with hypotenuse 15 and one leg 12,
so that's one of your three, four, five triangles but blown
up a little bit.
So we have at that moment that x is equal to 9.
And OK so at that moment to figure out
why, we can use this other relationship that we have,
so 20 over 15 is equal to y over 12.
So y is equal to well 20 over 15 times 12, so that's 4 over 3,
so that's 16.
So at our key moment in time, these are the values
that we're going to end up plugging in,
and also dx dt is equal to 5.
X is being increased.
Increased?
Yeah, x is right.
So as the foot gets pulled away, x is getting bigger.
So x is being increased at 5 units per second.
So these are all the things we're going to plug in.
All right, good.
So now, we are after dy dt at this moment.
So we know dx dt, we don't have a direct relationship
between y and x.
We do have a direct relationship between y and d.
So if we got dd dt, sorry, dd dt, then we could get dy dt.
And because of this relationship, we can get dd dt.
All right so let's start off by doing that.
So OK, so this is an identity.
It holds all ways so we can differentiate it.
And we're going to differentiate it with respect to t, x and d
are functions of t.
So OK, so differentiating this identity,
I get 2x times dx dt plus well OK derivative 144 with respect
to t is 0, is equal to, I guess I could expand this out
but it's easier just use the chain rule right away,
so this is equal to 2 times 20 minus d
times the derivative of 20 minus d with respect
to t, which is minus dd dt.
All right I beg the gods of math notation
to forgive me for dd dt but OK.
So, all right, so now so this is always true, and what we want
is the value of dd dt at our particular moment in time.
So at our particular moment in time,
we have, well let's, we have x, we have dx dt, and we have d.
So we can just plug all those things in.
So at our moment, let me see how I'm going to do this.
I'll do it over here.
At our moment, so 2x is 18 times dx dt
is 5 equals 2 times 20 minus d is 15 times minus dd dt.
And dd dt is what we're after, OK so we just divide through.
OK so divide 2 into this is 945 divided by 15 is 3.
So dd dt is equal to minus 3 at the moment
that we're interested in.
All right, great, great.
So now we have dd dt, and so now we
can go back to the second relationship
we have, the one that relates d and y,
and we can do the same thing here.
We can take a derivative, use the chain rule,
and get a relationship between dy dt and d and dd dt.
And then we'll be able to plug in all these values we
have for our particular moment.
So I think I'm just going to differentiate this straight.
There are some simplifications I could do first,
but it'll work fine if we just do it straight.
So OK so I need to compute the derivatives,
as an identity I can take its derivative.
So I differentiate the left hand side with respect to t,
so I get 20 over, so this is a minus first power,
so I get minus 20 over 20 minus d quantity squared times,
I need the derivative of the bottom, is minus dd dt.
And on the right hand side, I get dy dt over 12.
So I have this relationship between d and y,
I take its derivative, now I have
a relationship that involves dy dt, which is the thing
that I'm after.

So now, I'm back at this plugging in stage.
So at our moment in time, I know what d is,
and I just figured out what dd dt
is, so I can just plug those values in
to figure out what dy dt is.
OK so let's do that.
So at this moment in time, so let me just
multiply through by the 12 and that will let us solve.
So we have dy dt is equal to 12 times,
well so it's minus 20 over 15 squared times minus minus 3
times 3.
So this is-- all right arithmetic, not
my favorite thing in the world.
So we got two 3s here, we're going
to end up with a 5 and a denominator,
and then we've got 4 times minus 4.
So that's minus 16 over 5.
So all right.
So that's the answer.
Let's remember what we've done.
So minus 16 over 5, that's a negative number.
Why is it a negative number?
Well, as we pull this, the bottom of this ladder
here away from the wall, the top of the ladder
is going to fall downwards.
It's going to get closer to the ground.
And y is the vertical distance between the ground
and the top of the ladder, so that's shrinking.
Y is shrinking, it should have a negative derivative.
OK, negative derivative minus 16 over 5 feet per second.
So it would take, if this instantaneous rate held up,
which it won't in this situation, if it held up,
it would take 5 seconds to get down.
So it's not falling very quickly.
OK that seems about right.
Anything else?
I guess we computed that dd dt was also negative.
Same thing here, when you pull this way,
this length is going to shrink.
So d is getting smaller.
So it has negative derivative.

OK, so at this moment in time, the top of the ladder
is falling, the thing we're interested in at exactly
16 over 5 feet per second.
And we're all set.
