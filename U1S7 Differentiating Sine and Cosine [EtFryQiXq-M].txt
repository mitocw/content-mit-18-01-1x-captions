Sound, light, and electricity all involve oscillations.
Mechanical systems like bridges, car, and powerful tools
vibrate.
Neural activity in our central nervous system
occurs in wave patterns.
The whole world is full of oscillating behaviors.
Anything that oscillates, like this spray paint can
on a spring is modeled using the sine and cosine functions
that you already know from trigonometry.
Let's go ahead and find their derivatives.
Along the way, you will discover just
what is about the sine and cosine function that
make them so useful in modeling real world phenomena.
