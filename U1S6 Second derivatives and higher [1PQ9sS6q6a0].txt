I don't get it.
This news article says that the rate of job growth slows.
Can't they just say that the number of jobs has gone down?
Well, no.
That's not the same thing.
It's not?
Well, let me think about this.
So the rate of job growth, that's like
the rate of change of the number of jobs.
It's a derivative?
That's right.
So the headline is talking about a change in a rate of change.
So like a derivative of a derivative?
Can you do that?
Of course.
It's a second derivative.
Huh.
