Well, let me give you one more example here, which is just
slightly trickier, which involves-- so here's
another indeterminate form.

That's going to be 0 to the 0 power.

So I mean, there's lots of these things where you just
don't know what to do, and they come out
in various different ways.
The simplest example of this is the limit
as x goes to 0 from above of x to the x.

Now, in order to work out what's happening with this one,
we have to use a trick.
And the trick is that this is a moving exponent,
and so it's appropriate to use base e.
This is something that we did way back in the first unit.
So since we have a moving exponent,
we're going to use base e.
That's the good base to use whenever
you have a moving exponent.
And so we rewrite this as x to the x
is equal to e to the x log x.
And now, in order to figure out what's happening,
we really only have to know what's
going on with the exponent.

So remember-- actually, we already did this,
but I'm going to do it once more for you.
This is log x over 1 over x, and that's equivalence
as x goes to 0 to using L'hopital's rule to 1 over x,
and this is minus 1 over x squared,
which is minus x, which goes to 0 as x goes to 0.

And so what we have here is that this one is going
to be equivalent to-- well, it's going
to tend to what we've got over here, it's e to the zero.
That exponent is what we want as x goes to 0.
So that's the answer.
This limit happens to be 1.

It's actually relatively easy to do given all of the power
that we have at our hands.
