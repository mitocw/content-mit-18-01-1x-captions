Welcome back to recitation.
We're going to practice using some of the tools
you developed recently on taking derivatives
of exponential functions and taking derivatives
of logarithmic functions.
So I have three particular examples
that I want us to look at, and I'd
like us to find derivatives of the following functions.
The first one is f of x is equal to x
to the pi plus pi to the x, the second function
is g of x is equal to the natural log of cosine of x,
and the third one is--
that's an h, not a natural log--
h of x is equal to natural log of e to the x squared.
So you have three functions you want
to take the derivative of with respect to x.
I'm going to give you a moment to work on those
and figure those out using the tools you now have, and then
we'll come back and I will work them out for you as well.

OK.
So let's start off with the derivative of the first one.
OK.
Now the reason in particular that I
did this one might have seemed simple to you, but the reason
I did this one is because of a common mistake
that people make.
OK.
So the derivative of x to the pi is nice and simple,
because that is our rule we know for powers of x.
So we can write this as, that derivative is
pi times x to the pi minus 1.
OK?
But the whole point of this problem, for me,
is to make sure that you recognize that pi to the x
is not a power of x rule that needs to be applied.
It's actually an exponential function with base pi.
So if you wrote the derivative of this term was x times pi
to the x minus 1, you would not be alone in the world.
But that is not the correct answer, all the same,
because this is not a power of x, this is x is the power.
So this is an exponential function.
So the derivative of this, we need the rule
that we have for exponential--
derivatives of exponential functions.
So that's natural log of pi times pi to the x.
That's the derivative of pi of the x.
So that's the answer to number one.
OK.
Number two I did for another reason.
I think it's an interesting function once you find out
what the derivative is.
So this is going to require us to do the chain rule,
because we have a function of a function.
But you have seen many times now,
when you have natural log of a function,
its derivative is going to be 1 over the inside function times,
then, the derivative of the inside function.
So again, what we do is we take the derivative of natural log,
which is 1 over cosine x.
So we take the derivative of the natural log function,
evaluate it at cosine x, and then we
take the derivative of the inside function, which
is the derivative of cosine x.
You get negative sine x.
So you get-- this whole thing is negative sine over cosine,
so this is a negative tangent x.
So the reason I, in particular, like this one is that we see,
if I wanted to define a function whose derivative was tangent x,
a candidate would be the negative of the natural log
of cosine of x.
That, in fact, gives us a function
whose derivative is tangent x.
So it's interesting.
Now we see that there are trigonometric functions
that, I can take a derivative of something that's
not just trigonometric and get something that's trigonometric.
A So that's kind of a nice thing there.
And then the last one, example three,
I'll work out to the right.
There is a fast way and there is a slow way to do this,
so I will do the slow way first and then I'll
show you why it's good to kind of pull back from a problem
sometimes, see how you can make it a lot simpler for yourself,
and then solve the problem.
So I'll even write down, this is the slow way.

OK.
The slow way would be, well, I have a composition
of functions here.
I have natural log of something, and then I
have e to do something else, right?
And then that function, actually,
is not just e to the x.
So I have some things I have to--
I have to use the chain rule here.
OK?
So let's use the chain rule.
So I'll work from the outside in.
So the derivative of the natural log
function-- the derivative of natural log
of x is 1 over x, so I take the derivative of the natural log
function, I evaluate it here.
So the first part gives me 1 over e to the x squared.
And then I have to take the derivative
of the next inside function, which,
the next one inside after natural log
is e to the x squared.
And the derivative of that--
I'm going to do another chain rule--
I get e to the x squared times the derivative
of this x squared, which is 2x.
OK?
So again, this part is the derivative of the natural log
evaluated at e to the x squared, this part
is the derivative of e to the x squared.
This one comes just from the derivative of e
to the x is e to the x, and then so I evaluated x squared.
And then this is the derivative of the x squared part.
So I end up with the product of three functions
because I have a composition of three functions.
So I have to do the chain rule with three different pieces,
basically.
But this simplifies, right?
e to the squared divided by e to the x squared is 1,
so I get 2x.
OK.
So what's the fast way?
That's our answer, 2x, but what's the fast way?

Well, the fast way is to recognize that natural log of e
to the x squared--
let me erase the y here-- e to the x squared
is equal to x squared.
OK?
Why is that?
That's because natural log function
is the inverse of the exponential function with base
e, right?
This is something you've talked about before.
So this means that if I take natural log of e
to anything, here, I'm going to get that thing right there,
whatever that function is.
So natural log of e to the x squared is x squared.
OK?
If you don't like to talk about it that way,
if you don't like inverse functions,
you can use one of the rules of logarithms, which
says that this expression is equal to x
squared times natural log of e.
That's another way to think about this problem.
And then you should remember that natural log of e
is equal to 1.
So at some point, you have to know a little bit about logs
and exponentials, but the thing to recognize
is that h of x is just a fancy way of writing x squared.
And so the derivative of x squared is 2x.
So sometimes it's better to see what
can be done to make the problem a little easier.
But that is where we will stop with these.
