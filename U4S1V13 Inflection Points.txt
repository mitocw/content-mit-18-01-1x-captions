We've talked about how the second derivative can
be used to classify critical points using
the second derivative test, but it can also
be used to draw more accurate graphs.
Remember that the sign of the second derivative
on an interval tells us whether the graph is
concave up or concave down.
And to find the intervals on which
f double prime is positive or negative,
we can use our old friend interval sampling.
So for instance, let's say that f of x
is x to the fifth over 20 plus x to the fourth over 4.
Then f prime of x equals x to the fourth over 4 plus x cubed.
And f double prime of x equals x cubed plus 3x squared.
Now, that factors as x squared times x plus 3.
So drawing a number line, f double prime is 0 at x equals 0
and at x equals minus 3.
So we have three intervals to check.
We can start on the left.
If we look at f double prime over y minus 4,
that's equal negative 16.
So it's negative.
And that tells us that f double prime
is negative on this entire interval,
and therefore f is going to be concave down.

Over on this interval, f double prime of minus 1 is equal 2,
and that's positive.
So the second derivative will be positive on this stretch,
and f will be concave up.

A bit of terminology here.
A point where the second derivative switches sign
is called an inflection point.
So here at x equals minus 3, f double prime changes
from negative to positive.
f changes from being concave down to concave up.
That's an inflection point.
Inflection points are very important in how
humans visually perceive curves and surfaces.
So if you want to have good looking graphs,
these are a good thing to pay attention to.

What about here at x equals 0?
Is that an inflection point?
Well f double prime is equal 0 at x equals zero.
But if we test something over here,
let's say f double prime of 1, f double prime of 1 equals 4.
And that's positive.
So on this interval, f double prime is positive,
and f is concave up.
So to the left of 0, f is concave up,
and just to the right of 0, it's again concave up.
And that's telling us that 0 is not an inflection point.

Just a word of warning.
You might hear non-mathematicians
using the term, inflection point, in various ways.
For instance, they might say, company sales
hit an inflection point in June.
Now, if they mean that sales were accelerating, concave up,
and then in June they started to decelerate, concave down,
then that's a proper use of the term inflection point.
But a lot of times people just use
it to mean something has changed in some fashion that's
kind of vague.
For instance, I've seen the sentence,
the fall of the Berlin Wall was a political inflection point.
And that's just not very mathematical.
But for us, we've got a very specific meaning.
An inflection point is where specifically
the second derivative of the function changes sign.
We have a short question for you.
And then when we come back, we'll
see how we can put all of this information
together and get a really good graph for our function.
So stay tuned.
