So now, to differentiate any exponential,
there are two methods.

They're practically the same method.
They have the same amount of arithmetic.
But you'll see both of them.
And they're equally valuable.
So we're going to just describe.
So method one-- I'm going to illustrate on the function a
to the x.
So we're interested in differentiating
this thing, exactly this problem that I still didn't solve yet.
So here it is.
And here's the procedure.
The procedure is to write-- so the method is to use base e
or convert to base e.
So how do you convert to base e?
Well, you write a to the x as e to some power.
So what power is it?
Is e to the power log a to the power x?

And that is just e to the x log a.
All right, so we've made our conversion now to base e,
that exponential of something.
So now, I'm going to carry out the differentiation.
So d by dx of a to the x is equal to by dx of e
to the x log a.
And now, this is a step which causes great confusion when
you first see it.
And you must get used to it, because it's easy, not hard.

The rate of change of this with respect
to x is-- let me do it by analogy
here-- say I had e to the 3x, and I were differentiating it.
The chain rule would say that this
is just 3-- the rate of change of 3x with respect to x-- times
e to the 3x, the rate of change of e to the u with respect
to u.
So this is the ordinary chain rule.
Now, what we're doing up here is exactly the same thing,
because log a, as frightening as it looks with all three letters
there, is just a fixed number.
It's not moving.
It's a constant.
So the constant just accelerates the rate of change
by that factor, which is what the chain rule is doing.
So this is equal to log a times e to the x log a.
Same business here with log a replacing 3.
So this is something you've got to get used to in time
for the exam, for instance, because you're going
to be doing a million of these.
So do get used to it.
So here is the formula.
On the other hand, this expression here
was the same as a to the x.
So another way of writing this-- and I'll put this into a box,
but actually, I never remember this particularly,
I just re-derive it every time-- this
is the derivative of a to the x is equal to log a, a to the x.
Now, I'm going to get rid of what's underneath it.

So this is another formula.

So there's the formula.
I've essentially finished here.
And notice, what is the magic number?

The magic number is the natural log of a.
That's what it was.
We didn't know what it was in advance.
This is what it is.
It's the natural log of a.
Let me emphasize to you, again, something about what's
going on here, which has to do with scale change.

So for example, the derivative with respect to x of 2 to the x
is log 2 times 2 to the x.
The derivative with respect to x-- these are the two most
obvious bases that you might want to use--
is log 10 times 10 to the x.
So one of the things that's natural about the natural
logarithm is that even if we insisted
that we must use base 2 or that we must use base 10,
we still would be stuck with natural logarithms.
They come up naturally.
They're the ones which are independent
of our human constructs of base 2 and base 10.
The natural logarithm is the one that
comes up without reference.
And we will be mentioning a few other ways in which it's
natural later here.
