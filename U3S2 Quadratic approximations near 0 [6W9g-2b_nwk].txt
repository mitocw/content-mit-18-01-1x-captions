Near the point x equals 0 you found the formula
for the quadratic approximation of a function f.
And what you saw is that f of x is approximately equal to f
of 0 plus f prime of 0 times x plus f double prime of 0
divided by 2 times x squared.

And notice that these first two terms
are the linear approximation near x equals 0.
And this last term is the quadratic term.
We can also find a quadratic approximation
near any arbitrary point x equals a.
And the quadratic approximation of f
is given by this formula, f of x is approximately
equal to f of a plus f prime of a times the quantity
x minus a plus f double prime of a divided by 2 times
the quantity x minus a squared.
Similarly, this is the linear approximation near x equals a.
And this is the quadratic term.
You'll have an opportunity to practice using
this formula in a little bit.
But for right now I want to focus
on finding the quadratic approximations near x equals
0 of the basic functions.
So let's go ahead and erase this.

We've already done cosine of x.
But just to remind you cosine of x
is approximately equal to-- we'll
just apply this formula-- cosine of 0 minus sine of 0 times x
minus cosine of 0.
And then we need to not forget to divide this by 2
and multiply by x squared, which is equal to 1
minus x squared over 2.
Let's go ahead and find the quadratic approximation
of sine x.
From this formula near x equals 0
we get that this is approximately equal to sine
of 0 plus cosine of 0 times x minus sine of 0 divided
by 2 times x squared.
Both of these terms are 0.
So the only term surviving is this term.
And we get that sine x is approximately equal to x.
Notice that the quadratic approximation of the sign
is actually a linear function.
Because the quadratic term vanishes.

And let's just do one more.
Log of 1 plus x near x equals 0 is approximately equal to log
of 1 plus log prime at one times x plus
log double prime of 1 divided by 2 times x squared.
Well log of 1 is equal to 0.
And log prime of 1 is 1.
And log double prime of 1 is equal to negative 1.
You can check that on your own.
So the quadratic approximation is x minus x squared over 2.
And this is interesting because while the linear approximations
of these two functions are the same
the quadratic approximation shows that these functions are
quite different.
I'm going to go ahead and leave the rest
of the basic functions near x equal 0 for you to figure out.
And then just like we were able to do
with the linear approximations we'll
be able to use these quadratic approximations
of these basic functions near x equals 0 as building blocks
to find the quadratic approximations of more
complicated functions.
