At this point, we know how to take
derivatives of a lot of functions-- x
to the fourth, sine x.
We can take derivative of sums-- x to the fourth plus sine x.
We can even take derivative of product-- x
to the fourth times sine x.
But so far, we cannot take the derivative of tangent x,
which is the quotient function, sine x over cosine x.
So let's figure out how to differentiate quotients.
