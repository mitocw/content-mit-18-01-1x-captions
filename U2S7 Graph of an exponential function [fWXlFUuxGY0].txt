Let's look at an example of an exponential function.
The function I'm going to think about is f of x is equal to 2
to the x.
So the 2 is called the base of the function.
And the exponent is the x.
So in an exponential function, it
is the exponent that is varying or the exponent that
is the variable.
To understand this function, I want to graph it.
So let's plot some points.
The first value I want to look at is f of 0.
And at 0, that's 2 to the 0.
So that is equal to 1.
We're also going to look at f of 1, which is equal to 2
to the 1, which is 2.
f of 2 is equal to 2 squared, which is 4.
And so let's just draw in a couple
more points for negative integer values of x.
f of negative 1 is 2 to the minus 1, which is 1/2.
And f of negative 2 is equal to 1 over 2 squared or 1/4.
So we imagine extending this function continuously
to all real values of x.
And the graph of this function looks more or less like so.
Notice the trend of this function,
it is getting large very quickly.
At each integer value, it's going
to double as I move in the positive x direction.
And for each negative integer value,
it is going to decrease in value by half.
So it's getting very small, very close to 0 very quickly,
in the negative x direction.
Notice that this function is defined for all real numbers x.
It is continuous.
And it is everywhere positive.
And this is true for any exponential function
whose base is greater than 1.
Changing the base will simply change the shape or steepness,
but it will not change this global behavior.
Of course, we are interested in finding the derivative
of the exponential functions.
And this is not going to be an easy process.
Along the way, we are going to define e,
which is Euler's number, and we will find the derivative of e
to the x in this section.
In order to find an explicit formula for the derivative of 2
to the x and other exponential functions,
you're going to have to wait until we find the derivative
of the natural logarithm.
So there's a lot going on, but enjoy and have fun.
