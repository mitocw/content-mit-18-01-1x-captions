We can use the derivative to find
the slope of the tangent line to a graph of a function.
But what happens when we have a curve that
is not the graph of a function?
We can still ask for the slope of the tangent line.
So how do we find the formula?
In the case of a circle radius 5,
we can describe the curve with the implicit function x squared
plus y squared equals 25.
In this section, we learn how to differentiate
implicit functions by applying the chain rule.
