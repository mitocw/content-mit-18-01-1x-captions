Something you may have noticed is
that if we know where a function is increasing
and where it's decreasing, then we
can figure out how to classify all of its critical points,
whether they're local maxima or local minima or neither.
For instance, let's say we have a critical point here.
And for now, we'll be assuming that f
is continuous at these points.
If f is decreasing to the left of the point
and then it's increasing to the right to the point,
then we have a local minimum.
This is true whether the critical point
is one where f prime equals zero, like I've drawn,
or a corner where f prime doesn't exist.
And that would look like so.
For this purpose, we don't even have
to know all that much about f.
Since we're only talking about a local minimum,
we don't really care about what f
is doing far away as long as it's decreasing really,
really close to the point just to the left of it
and increasing in some little tiny interval
just to the right of the point, we get a local minimum.

If we express this not in terms of increasing or decreasing,
but in terms of the derivative, then we
get what is called the first derivative test.
Formally, it'll go like this.
Suppose f has a critical point at x=a and is continuous there,
then if f prime is less than 0 just to the left
of a-- in other words it's decreasing--
and if f prime is greater than 0 just to the right
of a-- in other words it's increasing--
then f has a local minimum at x=a
Similarly if f prime is positive just to the left of
and f prime is negative just to the right of a,
then f will look something like this near the point.
So we'll have a local max at a.

Finally, what happens if f prime is
the same sign just to the left and to the right of a?
If f prime is positive just to the left.
And then is positive again just to the right,
then we have a critical point looking like this.
And we'll get a similar thing if f prime
is negative and then negative.
I won't draw that.
So in this case, we conclude that f has neither a local min
nor a local max at x=a
So that is the first derivative test.
Why don't you play around with it?
