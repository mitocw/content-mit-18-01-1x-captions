How does an investigator determine time of death
at a crime scene?
We typically think of temperature
as a function of time.
We know the temperature of a body at the time of death,
and we can predict what the temperature will be after one
hour, two hours, et cetera.
But at a crime scene, we want to measure the temperature
and determine at what time the body was last alive.
Thinking of time as a function of temperature
is an example of an inverse function.
Inverse functions and their derivatives
are often important in problem solving,
so that is what we will focus on in this section.
