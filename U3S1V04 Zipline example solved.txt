You just worked out that the maximum velocity given a fixed
zip line height is V equal to 2 e over m, raised
to the one half power.
But we're interested in how this maximum velocity changes
when we change the height by some small amount, delta h.
So to do this, we need to find an expression
for the new maximum velocity.
In coming up with this expression,
we're going to need to take a linear approximation
of a function of the form 1 plus u to the r.
That's right, we're going to use the linear approximation
that you've just found.
So now, let's think about what happens to the velocity
if I change the total height by some small amount delta h.
Well, this is going to change the total energy in my system
because I'm going to add or subtract
some small amount of potential energy.
So the new system energy is given by e plus mg delta h.
Notice that this expression e plus mg delta
h is a linear expression in delta
h because the total energy e, this is constant,
m, the mass of the rider, is constant,
and g is the gravitational constant.
So we can use this formula to find the new velocity
by plugging in v plus delta v here, and then new energy here.
So solving for v plus delta v, I get
that this is equal to 2 times e plus mg delta h, all over m,
all raised to the one half power.
So I'm going to pull out this constant term, two e over m
to the one half power, and this is
going to simplify the expression v plus delta v is equal to 2
e over m to the one half power, times the quantity 1
plus mg delta h over e, raised to the one half power.
Notice that this term in parentheses has no units.
The one is unitless, mg delta h has units of energy,
and of course, e has units of energy.
So this summand is unitless.
And this term out in front, this multiplier,
has units of velocity.
In fact, this is the expression for the maximum velocity, V,
that you just found.
And this expression here in parentheses,
this is complicated because it's a non-linear expression
in delta h.
But this is something that we could
take a linear approximation of.
And we are interested in finding an approximation when
delta h is small.
That is, delta h is close to 0.
And when delta h is small, this entire summand
is close to zero.
And this expression looks an awful lot like 1
plus u to the r.
So we can apply the approximation that you found.
And what you saw was that 1 plus u to the r
is approximately equal to 1 plus ru, when u is close to 0.
So if we substitute one half for r, and mg delta h over e for u,
we get that 1 plus mg over e delta h to the one half power
is approximately equal to 1 plus one half times mg delta
h over e.
So the new maximum velocity, v plus delta v
is approximately equal to v times 1
plus m over 2 e, g times delta h.
Remember we're interested in delta v, how much
the maximum velocity changed.
So delta v is equal to v times m over 2 e, g times delta h.
Of course, if we remember that m over 2 e is 1 over v squared,
this is the same as g over v times delta h.
Now, I have a really easy way of estimating
how small changes in the height will change the velocity.
For example, if the maximum velocity of a rider
is 12 meters per second, and then I
change the total height of the ride
by 10 centimeters, or 0.1 meters,
then the change in the maximum velocity
is going to be approximately equal to 10
divided by 12 times 0.1.
Or 1/12 meters per second, which is approximately equal to 0.08
meters per second.
So that's not going to be a lot of change
in the maximum velocity, but it might
be just enough to make sure that a rider makes
it all the way to the platform on the other side of the ride.
Next, you are going to find linear approximations near x
equals 0 for all of the basic functions
that you know how to differentiate.
And then, I will show you how to use those linear approximations
of these basic functions to find approximations of much
more complicated functions.
