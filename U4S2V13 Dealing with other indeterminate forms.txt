In the problems that you just did,
you saw that forms 0 times infinity and infinity minus
infinity are indeterminate forms.
Why is that?
In both of these cases, if you look just at one part,
it's trying to make the result huge.
But if you look at the other part,
it's trying to make the result small.
So we can't tell which part is going
to win without digging in a little deeper.
The general approach to solving limits
of this type of indeterminate form
is to convert it through algebraic manipulation
into a quotient of the form 0 over 0
or infinity over infinity, so that we
can apply L'Hopital's rule.

Let's look at an example.
The example that I have here is x times log x.
As x approaches 0 from the right.
As x approaches zero from the right,
this limit tends towards 0 times negative infinity.
And I'm going to just point out that x times log
x is equal to log x divided by 1 over x.
And now, this looks like negative infinity
over infinity.
So I can apply L'Hopital's rule.
The derivative of the top is 1 over x.
The derivative of the bottom is negative 1 over x squared.
Simplifying, this is negative x, which
tends to 0 as x approaches 0 from the right.

We're going to leave it to you to figure out
how to manipulate a limit of the form infinity minus infinity
to get something that you can apply L'Hopital's rule to.
Good luck.
