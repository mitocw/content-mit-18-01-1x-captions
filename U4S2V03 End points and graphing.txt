You just evaluated this function from one side.
And if you follow through the other side,
so this one here, you get something very similar,
except that this should be-- oops, what did I do wrong?
I didn't want to-- I meant this.
OK.
I want it minus 2, the same base point,
but I want to go from the left.
All right.
So that's going to be negative 2 plus 1, same numerator.
And then this negative 2 on the left plus 2.
And that's going to come out to be negative 1 divided by 0
minus, which is plus infinity.
All right?
Or just plain infinity.
You don't have to put the plus sign in.
OK?
Now, so this is the first part of the problem.
And the second piece, to get ourselves started,
you could evaluate this function at any point.
This is just the most interesting point.
All right?
This is just the most interesting place
to evaluate it.
Now the next thing that I like to do
is to pay attention to the ends.

And I haven't really said what the ends are.
So the ends are just all the way to the left and all the way
to the right.
So that means x going to plus or minus infinity.
So that's the second thing I want to pay attention to.
Again, this is a little bit like a video screen here.
And we're about to discover something that's really
off the screen in both cases.
All right?
We're taking care of what's happening way to the left, way
to the right, here.
And up above, we just took care of what
happens way up and way down.
All right.
So on these ends, I need to do some more analysis, which
is related to a precalculus skill, which
is evaluating limits.
And here, the way to do it is to divide
by x in numerator and denominator,
right, as in 1 plus 1 over x, 1 plus 2 over x.
And then you can see what happens as x
goes to plus or minus infinity.
It just goes to 1.
So no matter whether x is positive or negative,
when it gets huge, these two extra numbers here go to 0.
And so this tends to 1.
So if you like, you could abbreviate this
as f plus or minus infinity is equal to 1.
All right.
So now I get to draw this.
And we draw this using asymptotes.
So there's a level, which is y equals 1.
And then there's another line to draw,
which is x equals negative 2.
All right?
And now, what information do I have so far?
Well, the information that I have so far
is that when we're coming in from the right, that's
this to negative 2, it goes plunges down to minus infinity.
So that's down like this.
OK?
And I also know that it goes up to infinity on the other side
of the asymptote.
And over here, I know it's going out to the level 1.
And here, it's also going to the level 1.
OK?
Now, there's an issue-- I can almost finish this graph now.
I almost have enough information to finish it.
But there's one thing which is making
me hesitate a little bit.
And that is, I don't know, for instance, over here,
whether it's going to maybe dip below and come back up or not.
So what does it do here?
Can anybody see?

Yeah?
It can't dip because there's no critical points.
It can't dip below because there are no critical points.
What a precisely correct answer.
So that's exactly right.
The point here is that because f prime is not 0,
it can't double back on itself because there can't be any
of these horizontal tangents.
All right?
It can't double back.
So it can't backtrack.

So sorry, if f prime is not 0, f can't backtrack.
All right?
And so that means that it doesn't look like this.
It just goes like this.
All right?
So that's basically it.
That's practically the end of the problem.
It goes like this.
All right.
Now, you can decorate your thing, right?
You may notice that it maybe crosses, here, the axis.
You can actually evaluate these places and so forth.
We're looking right now for qualitative behavior.
In fact, you can see where these places hit.
And it's actually a little higher up than I drew.
Maybe I'll draw it accurately so that you can see it,
because we'll see it in a second.
All right.
Anyway, so that's what happens to this function.
