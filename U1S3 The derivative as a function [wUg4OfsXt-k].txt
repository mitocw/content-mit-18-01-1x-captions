Every year at Halloween, MIT students
hurl pumpkins off the tallest building in campus.
This is called the pumpkin drop.
Certainly, the spectacle of the event
is all about the velocity of the pumpkin when
it hits the ground.
However, the velocity exists at every time
from the toss up to impact.
So, we can think of the velocity itself as a function of time.
We know that the velocity is the derivative of the position.
So, the derivative of a function is another function.
This is the concept we'll explore in this lesson.
