Welcome back.
I'm going to go ahead and add the critical point
at x equals e squared that you just found to the graph
we started in the last video.
And note that I'm not going to worry too much about what level
this point is at.
I'm just going to draw this picture qualitatively rather
than quantitatively.
I'm also going to add the information
that you found about the sign of the derivative
on each of these intervals.
What you saw was that f prime was greater than 0.
In other words, the function is increasing
on the intervals from 0 to 1 and from e squared to infinity.
And you saw that f prime was less than 0,
in other words, that the function is decreasing
on the interval from 1 to e squared.
So now we're almost done.
We can pretty much tell that the picture has this general shape.
But we're going to go ahead and look
at the second derivative of f.
This will allow us to double check
that e squared is in fact a minimum,
and we'll make our picture look even prettier by identifying
where the function is concave up and concave down.
So the second derivative is given by negative 2
log x plus 6, all over x log x to the 4.
We want to identify intervals where the second derivative is
positive and negative.
First, note that the denominator is always
positive on the intervals from 0 to 1 and from 1 to infinity.
This means that the sign of the second derivative of f
is the same as the sign of the numerator.
And the numerator is going to be 0 when x is equal to e cubed.
So I'm going to go ahead and add e cubed to my graph.
And I'm not going to worry too much about its value,
only that it's going to be greater than the value
at e squared, which is a local minimum.
So now let's check the sign of the second derivative
on the intervals from 0 to 1, from 1 to e cubed,
and from e cubed to infinity, since these
are the only intervals where the sign of the second derivative
could change.
On the interval from 0 to 1, log x is negative.
So the numerator of f double prime
is positive, which means that the second derivative itself is
positive on that interval.
On the interval from 1 to e cubed,
2 log x is smaller than 6.
So the numerator is going to be positive,
which means that the second derivative is
positive on that interval.
Note that this verifies that e squared is
in fact a local minimum.
If we had found that the second derivative was negative,
we would have known that we probably made
an algebraic error when we computed
one of the derivatives.
All that's left to check is the sign
of the second derivative on the interval from e
cubed to infinity.
On this interval, the numerator is negative.
So in fact, the function is concave
down on this interval, which means that e
cubed is an inflection point.
So now we have all the information,
and we can go ahead and put it all together
and finish our graph.

Note that nothing here was to scale, and that's OK.
When we ask you to sketch a graph by hand,
we aren't interested in seeing that you can plot exact points.
We want to see that you can draw the general shape of the curve
and label the important features.
As an example, I want to go ahead and show you
how I would draw this function using the sketch response
tool that we are going to be asking you to use
to sketch these functions.
Note that in this case, I don't have any labels on the x-axis.
This is a cue that we're only interested in a qualitative
drawing here and not an exact drawing.
So I'm going to go ahead and start labeling
this graph with information.
Notice that there are a bunch of tools up at the top
that I can choose from.
There's a function tool, which I'm going
to use to draw our function, f.
There's a vertical asymptote tool, a horizontal asymptote
tool, and some point tools.
Here, there's a critical point, an inflection point,
and an undefined point tool.
There are also some editing tools up here on the right.
There's a select tool, a delete tool, undo, and redo.
So first, I'm going to go ahead and draw
in the vertical asymptote.
Next, I'm going to select the undefined point tool,
and I'm going to drop an undefined point at x equals 0,
y equals 0, because the function is not defined at x equals 0,
but I do want to still capture the information
that the limit is 0, and that's why I use the undefined point
tool here.
I'm going to go ahead and wait to put any of the other points
in, because it's a little bit easier for me to label things
after I've drawn the curve than to try to first drop the points
and then make sure my curve goes through those points.
So instead, I'm just going to start drawing my function.
So select the function tool up at the top.
On the interval from 0 to 1, my function
is increasing and concave up.
So it looks something like that.
I'm actually not that happy with how that looked,
so I'm going to hit undo and draw it again.
OK, that's much prettier.
So now I'm going to draw the function over here.
I'm going to start at infinity at 1
and drop down to a local minimum.
Next, I will choose the critical point tool
and label that local minimum by just
dropping that point at the lowest point on this curve.
Next, I choose the inflection point tool
and I'll label this as the inflection point.
Then I will reselect the function tool
to draw the remainder of the curve.
And I know that this function is increasing to infinity
and concave down here.
So this is what we get.
And this is an example of a good qualitative sketch of what's
happening to this function.
If you decide later that you don't
like part of your drawing, you can hit Select up in the menu,
select the part of your graph that you don't like,
and you can either drag it or delete and redraw it.
So now it's your turn.
In the next problem, you're going
to use this sketch response tool to sketch a rational function.
Good luck.
