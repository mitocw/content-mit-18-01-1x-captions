We want to graph the function f of x
equals x divided by the quantity log of x squared.
You've already gotten started assembling the information
we need to graph this function.
And what you've done is you've identified the end points, 0
and infinity, as well as the discontinuity at x equals 1.
And you've also found that the right and left hand limits
as x tends towards 1 are both infinity.

To finish step one of the general strategy
we've developed for graphing functions, all we need to do
is look at what happens at the endpoints.
So let's start with 0.
We want to find the limit of f as x approaches 0
from the right.
This is 0 plus, which is our shorthand
notation for something a little bit bigger than 0,
divided by negative infinity squared.
And this is definitely going to tend towards 0.
So even though our function is undefined at x equals 0,
the limit from the right is well defined.
It's 0.
Next, let's look at what happens at the other endpoint-- that
is, as x tends towards infinity.
If we do the naive thing and plug infinity into f,
we get infinity over infinity.
And infinity over infinity is something
that we call an indeterminant form.
That means we don't immediately know how to evaluate something
that looks like this.
This is very similar to the case 0
over 0, which we've already talked about a lot before.
In this section, we're going to introduce L'Hospital's rule,
which will allow us to systematically evaluate limits
of indeterminate type 0 over 0, or infinity over infinity.
But for now, I'm just going to plug a large number
into this function, and we'll see that the output is also
a large number.
And this is going to suggest that this function is
going to tend towards infinity, as x tends towards infinity.
You'll be able to verify what we find with L'Hospital's rule
later, if you want to.
OK, so let's plug-in a big number.
Let's look at f of 10 to the 10, which
is 10 to the 10 over log of 10 to the 10 quantity squared.
And this is 10 to the 10 over 10 log 10 quantity squared, which
is approximately equal to 10 to 10
over 23 squared, which is something greater than 10
to the 7.
And since 10 to the 7 is quite large,
hopefully this convinces you that f really
is tending towards infinity.

So I'm going to go ahead and erase this computation now,
so we have more room to draw our graph.
Let's go ahead and put all the information
that we've gathered from the first step of our method
for drawing graphs into a picture.
So here's a set of axes, and I'll
draw a dotted vertical line to denote the vertical asymptote
at x equals 1.
Then I know that the function tends towards 0 as x
approaches 0 from the right.
Of course, the function isn't defined there,
so I'll denote this by drawing an open circle at the point x
equals 0, y equals 0.
The function f will be positive to the right of 0.
And then we know that the function
tends towards infinity from both the right and the left
as x approaches 1.

We've also just seen that our function approaches infinity
again as x tends towards infinity.
Note that at this point, we almost have enough information
to guess that we're going to find a critical point somewhere
in this region between 1 and infinity,
which is a local minimum.
But we're going to go ahead and let you carry out
the next step, which is finding the critical points
and evaluating the sign of the first derivative
in the next problems.
Then we'll be back to finish the remaining steps
and graph the full function after that.
