Now I want to answer the question, what can go wrong?
How can Newton's method fail to converge
to the root we're looking for?
What can go wrong is that the error term starts increasing.
And instead of getting small very quickly,
it gets large very quickly.
One of the ways this can happen, which
you saw in the last example, is that the initial guess
wasn't good enough.
The error, epsilon 0, was too big.
And the error increased in the next approximation.
And kept increasing in size during successive steps.
It may not converge at all, or it might actually
settle down and converge to some other root.
Something really interesting can happen sometimes
where the method can get stuck in a cycle,
bouncing between points forever, never converging to one point
and never diverging off to infinity either.
You'll get a chance to explore things like this later on.
What's the other way that the error can get big?
Well, remember that we said that epsilon sub
1 was on the order of epsilon 0 squared.
But what we really saw in our derivation
was that it was on the order of epsilon 0 squared, and divided
by f prime of x0.
So the other way that this method can fail
is that maybe we make a good guess for x0,
making the error epsilon 0 small.
But the slope of the tangent line to the function at x0
is very, very small.
We're never allowed to divide by zero.
And dividing by a very, very small number can be bad.
And so that's going to make this error get really big.
So what happens is that the x-intercept of this guess
could end up very, very far away from the point of interest
because the slope is so shallow.
In this case, the method may fail
to converge the correct root or fail to converge at all.
We have some more problems for you to practice thinking about.
Which guesses you should make, and how Newton's method
is going to behave after that.
And then this will conclude the section on Newton's method.
And after the problem sets, this actually
concludes the whole unit on approximations.
