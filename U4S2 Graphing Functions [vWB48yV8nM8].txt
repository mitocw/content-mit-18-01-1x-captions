Let me pick up where we left off with sketching.

So this is a continuation.

All right.
I want to give you one more example of how
to sketch things, and then we'll go through systematically.
So the second example-- we did one example last time--
is this.

The function is x plus 1 over x plus 2.
And I'm going to save you time right now.
This is very typical of me, especially
if you're in a hurry on an exam, I'll
just tell you what the derivative is.
So in this case, it's 1 over x plus 2 the quantity squared.
Now the reason why I'm bringing this example up--
even though it'll turn out to be relatively simple one
to sketch-- is that it's easy to fall
into a black hole with this problem.
OK?
So let me just show you.
This is not equal to 0 OK?
It's never equal to 0.
So that means there are no critical points.

OK?
At this point, many students who have been trained like monkeys
to do exactly what they've been told,
suddenly freeze and give up because there's nothing to do.
So this is the one thing that I have to train out of you.
You can't just give up at this point.
So what would you suggest?
OK?
Can anybody get us out of this jam?
Yeah?
Find the x values of which f prime of x and f of x
is undefined?
Right.
So the suggestion was to find the x values where f of x
is undefined.
So now that's a fairly sophisticated way
of putting the point that I want to make,
which is that what we want to do is go back
to our pre-calculus skills and just plot points.
OK?
So instead, you go back to pre-calculus
and you plot some points.
That's a perfectly reasonable thing.
Now it turns out that the most important point to plot
is the one that's not there, namely the value at x equals
negative 2, which is just what was suggested.
Namely, we plot the points where the function is not defined.
OK?
So how do we do that?
Well, you have to think about it for a second,
and I'll introduce some new notation when I do it.
If I evaluate 2 at this place, actually I can't do it.
I have to do it from the left and right.
So if I plug in minus 2 on the positive side
from the right, that's going to be equal to minus 2
plus 1 divided by minus 2, a little bit more than minus 2,
plus 2, which is negative 1 divided
by-- now this denominator is negative 2
a little more than that plus 2.
So it's a little more than 0.
All right?

And that is-- well we'll fill that in a second.
