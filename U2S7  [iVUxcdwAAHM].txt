I have to persuade you why e exists.

Alright?
So we have to have some explanation for why we know
that there is such a number.
OK?
So first of all, let me start with the one
that we supposedly know, which is the function 2 to the x.
We'll call it f of x is 2 to the x.
Alright?
So that's the first thing.
And remember that the property that it had with f prime of 0
was m of 2.
That was the derivative of this function,
the slope at x equals 0 of the graph,
of the tangent line that is.
So now, what we're going to consider here
is any kind of stretching.
We're going to stretch this function
by a factor k, any number k.
So what we're going to consider is f of kx.

Now if you do that, that's the same as 2 to the kx, right?
But now if I use the second law of exponents
that I have over there, that's the same thing as 2
to the k to the power x, which is the same thing as some base
b to the x where b is equal to-- so let's just write that down
over here-- b is 2 to the k.

Alright?
So whatever it is, if I have a different base which
is expressed in terms of 2 by being of the form 2 to the k,
then that new function is described by this function
f of kx, this stretch.
So what happens when you stretch a function?
That's the same thing as shrinking the x-axis.
So when k gets larger, this corresponding point over here
would be over here and so this corresponding point
would be over here.
So you shrink this picture.
And this slope here tilts up.
So as we increase k, the slope gets steeper and steeper.
Let's see that explicitly numerically here.
Explicitly numerically, if I take the derivative here,
so the derivative with respect to x
of b to the x, that's the same thing as well, that's the chain
rule, right?
That's the derivative with respect
to x of f of kx, which is what?
It's k times f prime of kx.
And so if we do it at 0, we're just
getting k times f prime of 0, which is k times this m of 2.
So how is it exactly that we cook up the right base b?
So b equals e when k is equal to the 1 over this number.
In other words, we can pick all possible slopes that we want.
This has the effect of multiplying a slope
by a factor.
And we can shift the slope at 0 however we want.
And we're going to do it so that the slope exactly matches
1, the one that we want.
we still don't know what k is.
We still know what e is.
But at least we know that it's there somewhere.
