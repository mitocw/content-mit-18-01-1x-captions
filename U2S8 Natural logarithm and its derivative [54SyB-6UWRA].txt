We want to find the derivative of log x with respect to x.
To do this, we are going to use the fact
that the function e to the x is the inverse
of the natural logarithm.
What does this mean?
This exactly says that e to the log x is equal to x.
If we let u equal log x, then this equation
is exactly saying that e to the u is equal to x.
So now, we're going to start with this equation,
and we are going to implicitly differentiate.
I'm leaving some room here, so that I can differentiate
both sides with respect to x.

The derivative of x with respect to x is equal to 1.
Applying the chain rule, we can find the derivative
of the left hand side, which is equal to the derivative
with respect to u of e to the u times the derivative of u
with respect to x.
Notice that du dx here is the unknown quantity.
But we know that the right hand side is equal to 1,
and we can compute this derivative here.
The derivative of e to the u with respect to u
is e to the u.
So this gives us e to the u times du dx is equal to 1.

Remember that e to the u is just a fancy way of writing x.
So plugging in log x for u, we see
that x times the derivative of log x with respect to x
is equal to 1.
Rearranging, this is the derivative
of log x with respect to x is equal to 1/x.
I'm going to go ahead and write that up here and box it.
And now, we have another function
to add to our arsenal of functions
that we know how to differentiate.
