Imagine that we want to send a probe close to the sun.
Not only will we have to make sure it doesn't get too hot,
but we'll also have to pay attention
to the rate of change of temperature.
If the probe heats or cools too quickly, it can crack.
The temperature is a function of the distance from the sun,
and the distance from the sun is a function of time.
That means that, to find temperature
as a function of time, we need to take the composition
of these two functions.
To get the rate of change of the temperature,
we'll want the derivative of this composition.
Differentiating the composition of functions
requires the chain rule, and that's
what you'll learn about in this section.
So let's get to work.
