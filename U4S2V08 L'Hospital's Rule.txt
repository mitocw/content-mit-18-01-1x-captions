Here we're going to introduce L'Hopital's Rule, also known
as Hospital's Rule.
This is the English spelling and pronunciation,
so you'll see it written in textbooks this way as well.
Why should you care?
L'Hopital's Rule is a systematic method
that uses derivatives to evaluate limits
of indeterminate forms of type 0/0 and infinity over infinity.

We're going to give you two versions of this rule.

Version 1 is for limits of indeterminate form 0/0.
It says that if f and g are functions
that tend to 0 as x approaches some number a,
and f and g are differentiable near the point
x equals a, then the limit as x approaches a of the quotient
f of x over g of x is equal to the limit
as x approaches a of f prime of x over g prime of x provided
that the right hand side exists or is plus or minus infinity.
It may seem odd that we are allowing this limit
to be plus or minus infinity.
But keep in mind that this is exactly the type of information
that can be very useful to us, especially when
we are sketching a function.

Next, we'll introduce version 2 .
Version 2 is for limits of indeterminate form
infinity over infinity.
The only difference between version 1 and version 2
is that we allow f and g to tend to plus or minus infinity
as x approaches some number a.
Notice that version 1 and version 2
have very opposite hypotheses, but the exact same formula
is true in both cases.
This is rather surprising.
And it's worth mentioning the fact
that the proofs of version 1 and version 2 are very different.
In this course, we will only be showing
you a proof of a special case of version 1
where we know that the derivative of f and g
exist at the point a, not just near the point x equals a.

There are a couple more things that I just
wanted to point out.
One is that everywhere in this rule,
we have limits as x approaches some number a.
And these are all two-sided limits.
But we can replace this two-sided limit
with a right-sided limit or a left-sided limit
everywhere in the rule-- that is,
we could replace x goes to a by x goes to a plus
or x goes to a minus everywhere that you
see this limit and the rule.
And the result of the rule still holds in both version 1
and version 2.
The other thing that is important to note
is that here we have been implicitly assuming
that a is a finite number.
But in fact, we can let x tend to plus or minus infinity,
and both version 1 and version 2 of this rule still hold.
Part of what makes this rule so incredibly powerful
is the fact that it holds for two very different cases-- 0/0
and infinity over infinity.
And it works in every possible iteration
that you can imagine-- one-sided limits, two-sided limits,
limits as x tends to infinity.
You can always apply this rule when
you have a limit of indeterminate type
0/0 or infinity over infinity.
And that is what makes it so convenient.
I'm going to go ahead and let you take a moment
to let this rule sink in before I come back
and show you how to apply L'Hopital's Rule in practice.
