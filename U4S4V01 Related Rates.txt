Let's consider two different scenarios.
In the first scenario, an inmate is breaking out of prison.
We know how quickly the spotlight rotates,
and the distance to the wall.
How quickly does the spotlight move along the wall?
Does the prisoner have any hope of escape?
During an oil spill, assume that crude oil leaks
into the water at a rate of 2000 cubic meters per hour
for three days.
If we assume the oil formed a thin circular patch
on the surface of the water, how fast
was the edge of the patch moving?
What do these two problems have in common?
In each problem, we know one rate of change,
and we are looking for a different rate of change.
These rates are related.
The key to solving these problems is to draw a picture,
find a formula, and implicitly differentiate.
