So let's look at an example.
The function I want to consider is
e to the negative 3x divided by the square root of 1 plus x.
And you actually just computed the linear approximation
of this function directly for values of x near 0.
But what I want to show you is that we can actually
find the linear approximation of this product
by taking a product of linear approximations.
So first, let's start by rewriting this.
This is equal to e to the negative 3x times
the quantity 1 plus x to the negative 1/2 power.
So let's start by finding the linear approximation
of each term.
e to the negative 3x is going to be the same
as the linear approximation of e to the u, where
u is equal to negative 3x.
Note that this is a valid substitution,
because as x approaches 0, negative 3x, or u,
also approaches 0.
So this is approximately equal to 1 plus
u, which is 1 minus 3x.
And a linear approximation for 1 plus x to the negative 1/2
is given by 1 minus x/2.
So to find the linear approximation of this product,
we are going to take the product of the linear approximations.
Multiplying out term by term, I get 1 minus 1/2 x minus 3x
plus 3/2 x squared.
And I'm going to kill this x squared term.
And I'm left with 1 minus 7/2 x.
And hopefully, this agrees with the linear approximation
that you computed directly before this video.
So why am I killing off this quadratic term?
There are two reasons.
One is that it's negligible.
I'm taking this approximation for values of x near 0.
So if x is on the order of 1/100,
then this term x squared is on the order of 1/10,000,
so it's very, very small.
And the other reason that I'm getting rid of it
is that it doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't have any meaning.
This quadratic term is describing some curvature.
But this isn't the curvature of the function in question.
If we wanted to describe the function with more terms
and as a quadratic, we would have
had to start with quadratic terms for that to make sense.
This is very similar to when you were making measurements
and using significant figures.
If you have two distances measured up
to two significant figures and you
take the product to find the area,
you might have a number with four digits in the product.
But only two of those digits are significant.
And this comes from the inherent error in your measurement,
that product measurement only make sense
to two significant figures.
It's the same here.
When I take a product of two linear approximations,
I can stop as soon as I have all of the linear terms.
Any terms beyond that are just going to be junk terms.
And they're not going to have any sensible meaning
to the function that we started with.

This wraps up the tools and tricks
for finding linear approximations
of complicated functions.
I'm going to let you get some practice.
And then we're going to do another example
and see how to think about measurement error
when we're doing computations.
