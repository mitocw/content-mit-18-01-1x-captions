Welcome back to recitation.
Today what I want to do is something maybe a little bit
more theoretical.
But the goal is to show that something
that you're going to be repeatedly doing
when you use quadratic approximations is in fact true.
So I'm going to explain the situation,
give a quick example, and then show you
what we're setting out to do.
So the situation is as follows.
Anytime you see a Q of f, that's going
to represent the quadratic approximation to f
at x equals 0.
So what I've done is say Q of f I'm
going to define to be the thing on the right, which is exactly
the formula you were given in class
for the quadratic approximation of a function f at x equals 0.
So f is approximately the thing on the right near 0.
Our goal is to show that if I want
to take the quadratic approximation
of a product of two functions that I
can do it in a different way.
I can do it in the way written on the right hand side, which
actually looks more complicated in this notation,
but is in fact easier in reality.
So let me explain what's happening
and then I'll give you an example.
If I wanted to take the quadratic approximation
of a product of two functions, what I want to show
is that instead I could take the quadratic approximation
of each individual function, multiply those together,
and then take the quadratic approximation of what
I get as a result.
So let me give you an easy example.
For instance, let's let f of x equal e to the x.
And let's let g of x equal sin x.
OK.
Then what is Q of f?
Q of f is the quadratic approximation to e to the x
at x equals 0.
And that's going to be 1 plus x plus x squared over 2.
You already knew this.
And g, the quadratic approximation of sine x,
is just x.
So if I wanted to find the quadratic approximation e
to the x sin x, what this is claiming I can do,
is instead I can take the quadratic approximation
of this function times this function.
So instead I can take the quadratic approximation
of f was e the x, 1 plus x plus x squared over 2 times x.
That's not a 4.
Sorry that's a parentheses.
1 plus x plus squared over 2 times x.
And what is that?
The quadratic approximation to that
is a quadratic approximation to x plus x
squared plus x cubed over 2.
And at x equals 0, if I have a polynomial,
the quadratic approximation to a polynomial at x equals 0
is just all the terms up to the quadratic term.
So I drop off higher order terms.
So I just get x plus x squared.
So that's the idea.
The idea is I have a product of two functions.
I know they're individual quadratic approximations.
And so what I want to do is I want
to find the quadratic approximation of this product
by exploiting the fact that I already
know there are individual ones.
And exploiting the fact that quadratic approximation
of polynomials at x equal 0 is very easy.
So that's the example.
That's the idea.
So now let's see if we can do it.
OK.
So we have a cheat sheet up here that I'm
going to refer back to.
I didn't want to use it again.
And I didn't want to have to derive this for you.
But we have the product rule, fg prime
is equal to what's on the right, and fg
double prime is equal to what's on the right.
So my goal here is to show-- remember
that the quadratic approximation-- let
me point over here again.
The goal is to show the quadratic approximation of fg
is equal to the quadratic approximation
of quadratic approximation of f times the quadratic
approximation of g.
Well, let's do the right hand side first
because that's a little nicer.
And then we'll show the right hand side
and then we'll show the left hand side.
And we'll show their equal.
So let me start here with the right hand side.

OK.
So let's look at what's the quadratic approximation of f?
And what's the quadratic approximation of g?
And then we'll take their final quadratic approximation.
So Q of f, we have exactly what we need there.
f or 0 plus f prime of 0 times x plus f double prime of 0 over 2
x squared.
Q of g is equal to g of 0, plus g prime
of 0 times x, plus g double prime at 0 over 2 x squared.
So now what I'm going to do is multiply those two together.
And I'm actually going to swing this way a tiny bit,
if that's OK, to write Q of f times Q of g
because it's going to be a little long.
And I'm going to group them carefully so
that I have all the higher order terms at the end.
OK.
So I'm going to get f of 0 g of zero
by multiplying these two together.
And then I'm going to get two terms involving an x.
I'm going to get an f prime time g and a g prime times f.
Actually, if you'll allow me, we'll
know that anywhere we see an f or a g
or an f prime or a g prime or an f double prime
or g double prime, they're all evaluated at 0.
So I'm going to drop the zeros from here on out.
Anywhere you see those I'm evaluating them at 0,
otherwise this will be way too long.
So let me write this just as fg.
I can even write just the single one evaluated and 0.
It's the product evaluated at 0.
And then I have f prime g.
So I'll just evaluate at 0 at the end of the product.
Plus fg prime evaluated 0.
This whole thing is times x.
I get an x here.
I get an x here.
Now, I need to figure out what terms give me an x squared.
OK.
So the terms that give me an x squared
are f of 0 times g double prime over 2.
That gives me an x squared.
F double prime times g gives me an x squared.
And f prime g prime gives me an x squared.
So let's write out those terms.
I get fg double prime at 0 over 2 from those two.
Plus gf double prime at 0 over 2 from those two.
Plus f prime g prime 0 all times x squared.
So there's an x times an x there gives you x squared.
x squared there.
X squared there.
Now, I could keep going.
And I will mention the higher order terms.
But I'm not going to write them all the way out because of what
we're about to do.
Let me show you where they come from.
You get an x cubed term from here,
and an x cubed term from here.
Maybe I'll write the x cubes but I won't write the x
to the fourth.
So the x cubed terms are f prime g double prime 0 over 2,
plus g prime f double prime at 0 over 2.
And those are my x cubed terms.
And then I get some x to the fourth terms.

And where do the x to the fourth terms come from?
They come from this product.

But I want to point out something.
What I'm going to do--
I'm going to work some magic on the board.
This is a quadratic approximation
of f times the quadratic approximation of g.
Let me come over here and remind you
that I want the quadratic approximation of that product.
So what I'm going to do is go back
and look at what I need from there
to be the quadratic proclamation of that product.
So if we come back over here, if I
apply the quadratic approximation
to this thing, which means then I'm
applying it to this whole giant thing, what do I actually get?
This is actually a polynomial.
I have a linear term.
I have an x.
I have an x squared.
I have a x cubed.
And I have an x to the fourth.
So if I apply that quadratic approximation,
let's see what stays.
This term stays.
This term stays.
This term stays.
I'm going to erase what disappears because I don't want
us to get confused by that.
So these two terms disappear.
Why?
Because again this is a polynomial.
I have linear or I have constant--
I'm sorry I think I called this maybe linear
earlier-- constant, linear, quadratic term.
And what I need is just those if I'm looking
for a quadratic approximation.
So constant, linear, quadratic term
I immediately dropped the cubic and the quartic term
when I'm looking at a quadratic approximation
of a polynomial at 0.
So if I want the right hand side,
I just need what's underlined in blue.
So now, I'm going to put a big box around that because that's
going to be important.
Whatever else happens we don't want to lose that.
So now we've done the right hand side.
And now, let's write out what is the left hand side.
And that's just going to be plugging it
straight into the formula.

And using our cheat sheet.

So Q of fg, let me write out the definition
and then we'll use the cheat sheet, it's fg a 0.
Again this is f at 0, g at 0-- that's what this notation
means--
plus fg quantity prime at 0 times
x plus quantity fg double prime at 0 over 2 times x squared.
And now, what we're hoping, remember,
is that what's in the box is what shows up over here.
Because this is a long way to do the problem.
This would be if I took to e to the x sin x,
and I took all the derivatives.
And this in fact, even though it looks
more confusing in evaluating such and such
a quadratic approximation, this way would be the easier way.
We just want to show we don't lose anything by doing
what would be the easier way.
So I get fg at 0.
And that's good.
We can see we already have one of those.
So that's nice.
What do I get here?
I get f prime g at 0, plus g prime f at 0, times x.
That comes let me remind you, I'll walk over here,
comes from the cheat sheet.
The first thing.
fg prime is f prime g plus g prime f.
We know that one pretty well.
But just to remind you.
So that's where this term comes from.
This looks promising because if we come back
to our quadratic of quadratic of f times quadratic of g,
it looks exactly like the second term here.
So now we're hoping that the x squared term looks like this.
The only thing that might make you nervous
is this doesn't have an over 2.
But if you were paying attention to the cheat sheet
you'll probably see where that's coming.
And I'll point it out in one moment.
So fg double prime using the cheat sheet
is f double prime g, plus g double prime
f, plus 2 g prime f prime.
I should've put zeros in there.
Just to be consistent let me put the zeros in there.

Two f prime g prime at 0.
And then I have to divide the whole thing by 2
because there's a divided by 2 there.
And then times x squared.
So let me move out of the way for a moment.
So this numerator came from the cheat sheet
for the second derivative.
And if you need, we can go back, let me just remind you here
it is, you can work it out for yourself.
You can just take the derivative of the first derivative.
But that's where this comes from.
So let me go back and we're almost done with the problem.

So what do we see?
Well, we see that we get fg at 0.
We get the second term we want f prime g at 0,
plus g prime f at 0 times x.
And in the third term is in fact exactly what we want because we
get f double prime g at 0 over 2, plus g double prime f at 0
over 2, plus the twos divide out,
and I get f prime g prime at 0 times x squared.
And if we took a look at this last term,
and we look at the x squared term in the box,
we see in fact they are exactly the same.
So let me summarize because this was kind of a long video.
So I'm going to go back to the beginning,
give you the example, and tell you what we were really
trying to do here.
So let's come back over here.
And let me remind you the goal was
to show that if I wanted to take a quadratic approximation
of a product of two functions, if I already
knew their individual quadratic approximations
you were told that you could take those two
quadratic approximations, multiply them, and drop off
the higher order terms.
The higher order than 2.
So we had an example, we knew these two
quadratic approximations.
And you've been told that quadratic approximation
of their product is just a quadratic approximation
of the product of their quadratic approximations.
And so our goal today was to show
that you don't drop any of the terms
that you get if you do it by this method or by this method.
And we've done that.
So I think I'll stop there.
