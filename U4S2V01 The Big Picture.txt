We can sketch graphs of functions f of t
using derivatives.
But this doesn't tell us what happens at infinity.
Does the function settle along asymptotes?
Or does it grow without bound?
If so, how fast is it growing?
The long-term behavior of functions
is important in many fields.
Chemists are interested in the steady states
proportion of chemical species after a reaction.
Computer scientists are interested in the run times
amalgamated on large data sets.
Economists try to predict the future behavior of the stock
market.
In this section, we'll see how once again the derivative
is used to understand the behavior of functions
at infinity.
