You saw that by making a guess of x0 equals 1,
we could approximate the root of the function, f
of x equals 2 minus x squared, by using
the x-intercept of the linear approximation
to f, at x equals 1.
Which gave us an approximation that we called x sub 1.
And this approximation was slightly better.
The key idea-- the insight-- is that we
can repeat this process.
So I'm going to take another linear approximation
of the function f of x.
But this time, I'm going to take it at the point x sub 1.
And the next approximation of the root
is going to be the x-intercept of this tangent line.
Already you can see that this second approximation, x sub 2,
is a lot closer.
Close enough that geometrically, I can't really distinguish it
from the actual root anymore.

Let's go ahead and move to the mathematics.
I'm going to erase this example for now,
and keep the picture so we remember what is going on.
And I'm going to outline the steps of the algorithm that
is known as Newton's method, or the Newton-Raphson method.
Step one, make a guess, x0.
Step two, find the x-intercept, x sub one, of the tangent line
to f at x0.
The tangent line at x0 is given by this equation.
f of x0, plus f prime of x not, times the quantity x minus x0.
To find the x-intercept we're going
to set this equation equal to 0, and solve for x sub 1.
We're going to skip the algebra, but you can pause the video
to work it out on your own.
Solving for x1 we get this equation.
x sub 1 is equal to x0 minus f of x0,
divided by f prime of x0.

Step three, repeat.
We're going to promote 0 to 1, and promote 1 to 2,
and find the x-intercept of the green line now.
The key is that the algebra exactly
repeats the same pattern by just replacing 0 with 1,
and 1 with 2.
So we get that the next approximation, x sub 2,
is equal to x sub 1 minus f of x sub 1, divided by f prime of x
sub 1.
Now I'm going to erase the geometric pictures
so that I have some space to write the general formula.
In general, the n plus first approximation to the root
is given by the nth approximation, x sub n,
minus f of x sub n, divided by f prime of x of n.
Let's go back to see how this plays out
with the example, f of x is equal to 2 minus x squared.
We're going to need the derivative, f prime
of x, which is negative 2x.
So we had that x sub naught was equal to 1.
Then x sub 1 is going to be equal to x0, minus 2
minus x0 squared, divided by negative 2x0.
That's just f of x0, divided by f prime of x0.
And that's equal to 1 minus, 2 minus 1 squared,
all over negative 2, which gives us 1.5.
Then x2 is equal to x sub 1, minus 2 minus x sub 1
squared, divided by negative 2 x sub 1,
and that gives us 1.416 repeating.
x sub 3 is x sub 2 minus the quantity, 2 minus x sub
2 squared, all over negative 2 x sub 2, which gives us 1.41425.
x sub 4 is equal to this number, and we
get the exact same number for x sub 5.
So note that after only five steps,
our approximation agrees with the actual numeric value
of the square root of 2, up to 10 decimal places.
That's pretty good so now it's your turn
to get some practice using Newton's method.
