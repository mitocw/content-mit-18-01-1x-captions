Consider bacteria in a Petri dish.
The more bacteria there are, the faster the bacteria multiply.
This is an example of exponential growth.
In contrast, the amplitude of a spring mass system
decreases over time.
This is described by exponential decay.
The exponential function is ubiquitous,
and not just in math.
It also comes up in physics, engineering, economics,
and computation.
So it's essential that we figure out
how to differentiate it, which is what we'll do now.
