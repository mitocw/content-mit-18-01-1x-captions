Let's suppose that this is the graph for our function f.
We said that 2, 5 is on the graph.
And so that means that when you input 2 into f,
you're going to get 5.
Now if f has an inverse function that would mean that f
inverse of 5 equals 2.
So for f inverse, 5 is the input and 2 is the output.
And so the point that has 5 as its first coordinate and 2
as its second coordinate, that's going to be
on the graph of f inverse.
Similarly if this is the point 0, 2, then we know that f of 0
equals 2.
So f inverse of 2 will equal zero.
And that means that 2, 0 will be another point
on the graph of f inverse.

So we see that the first and second coordinates
of these points are getting switched
when we go to the inverse.
So geometrically, this means that the horizontal axis
and the vertical axis are getting swapped.
So we're reflecting across this 45 degree line.
And that's the line y equals x.
So this point will go across to this point.
This point reflects to this one.
And this will happen for every single point on the graph of f.
So if f has an inverse function, then the full graph
of f inverse will be what we get if we reflect the entire curve.
And it'll look something like this.

I really love this picture, because from this principle
that the graph of f inverse is just
a reflection of the graph of f, you
can figure out pretty much anything
you need to know about inverse functions
that you'll need for this course.
So hopefully you'll like it too.
