In this video, we'll look at a situation
where the techniques regarding critical points
that we've developed so far run into a little difficulty.
And then we'll introduce a new test that
can help us solve the issue.

You just looked at the function f
of x equals x squared plus 3 cosine x.
And here the derivative f prime of x equals 2 x minus 3 sine x.
So if you calculate f prime of 0, you get 0.
That means we have a critical point at x equals 0.
And we sampled some other value of f prime. f prime
of pi over 2 was positive.
And f prime of minus pi over 2, we saw, was negative.
But if you did the problem and looked at the solution,
then you'd realize that this isn't enough information
to tell us what's going on at this critical point.
We can't use the first derivative test just yet.
Why?
What's going on?

Well, in order to use the first derivative test,
we need to know the sign of f prime just to the left and just
to the right of the critical point.
We know the sign of f prime of pi over 2,
but that's way over here.
In the past, we've used that bit of information
for interval sampling.
OK, it's positive here, so f prime
is going to be positive over a certain interval.
But the problem is that right now we don't
know what the intervals are.
f prime is positive here in your pi over 2,
but it's very possible that it could switch sign at some point
before x reaches zero.
And the reason we're unsure is because we haven't found
all the critical points yet.
There could be one somewhere in here.

Can we find all of the critical points?
Well, that would require solving the equation f prime of x
equals 0, or 2x minus 3 sine x equals 0.
And I don't know how to do that algebraically.
That's a little bit of a problem.
We could solve it numerically, but that's
pretty time consuming.
Luckily, there is another way, and it involves not just
the first derivative of f, but also the second derivative.
f double prime of x equals 2 minus 3 cosine x.
And so f double prime of 0 is minus 1, which is negative.
What does that tell us?
Let me give you a couple of arguments.
First, f double prime of 0 is the derivative of f prime at 0.
And the fact that it's negative tells us
that f prime is going downward near 0.
And since we're only talking about local mins
or local maxes, near zero is really all we care about.
So f prime will be bigger just to the left of 0,
and smaller just to the right of 0.
f prime equals 0 here, so bigger than that means
it's positive just to the left.
And smaller than that means it's negative over here,
just to the right.
So there we go.
f prime is positive just to the left.
So f will increase up until x equals 0.
And then after that, f prime is negative, so f will decrease.
We're back to the first derivative test, basically,
local max.

If you'd prefer a more geometric way of thinking,
just remember that f double prime being negative
is associated with the graph being concave down.
And concave down is going to have this shape.

So we have what's called the second derivative test.
And it goes like this.
Suppose that f prime of a equals 0.
So it's a critical point and we want to know
is it a local min or a local max, or neither?
Then if we calculate f double prime of a and it's negative,
then a is a local max.
That's the thing we just argued.
If f double prime of a is positive,
then we have a local min.
And if f double prime of a equals 0,
then-- now most of you are probably
expecting me to say neither a local min or local max,
but it's actually a little bit more complicated than that.
So we have a few exercises for you
to actually figure out what goes in this space.
Hope you enjoy them.
