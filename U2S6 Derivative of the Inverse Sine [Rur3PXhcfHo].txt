In our last video, we derived this formula
for the derivative of an inverse function.
If g is f inverse, then g prime of x
equals 1 over f prime of g of x.
Now let's use that to calculate the derivative
of the arcsine function.
This, of course, is the inverse of the sine function.
So in the formula we have, f is the sine function,
and g is the arcsine function.
So for the derivative, we're supposed
to have 1 over f prime of g of x.
So instead of f prime, we'll write sine prime.
And then of g of x means of arcsine x.

The derivative of sine is cosine.
So this ends up as 1 over cosine of arcsine x.
It's a trig function of an inverse trig function.
I told you that would be useful.

Now arcsine x is an angle theta.
And we know it's an angle whose sine is x.
And we can draw that using a right triangle.
Let me get rid of this.
And then here's our right triangle.
If this leg is x, and the hypotenuse is 1,
then this angle has its sine equal to x.
So that's our theta.
Right now we're dealing with x positive.
We'll talk about x negative a little bit later.
But in any case, we want the cosine of theta.
So we need this leg, which by the Pythagorean theorem,
will be the square root of 1 minus x squared.
So cosine theta will be the square root of 1
minus x squared over the hypotenuse, which is just 1.
So for our derivative down below,
we're going to end up with 1 over.
And then cosine theta is just square root of 1
minus x squared.
And that's our answer.
If x is negative, then arcsine x will
fall in the negative part of its range.
So theta will be between 0 and minus pi over 2.
And that means that if we draw the unit circle,
theta is going to be this way, and we
get a triangle like this.
And this is our x.
And it's negative, because this leg is downward.
But in this quadrant, cosine theta is still positive.
And we're still going to get the square root of 1
minus x squared as its value.
So our answer down below of 1 over the square root
of 1 minus x squared that works for positive or negative x.

However, we do need x to be between 1 and minus 1.
If x is outside that range, then we
would be taking the square root of a negative number
and that's not so good.
But the arcsine function has a domain
that only goes from minus 1 to 1 anyway, so that works out OK.
One small issue is that 1 and minus 1
are in the domain of the arcsine function,
but if we plug them into this formula for the derivative,
we get a 0 denominator.
The reason for that can be seen in the graph
of the arcsine function.
This is the reflection of the graph of the sine function--
or part of it anyway-- and we can
see that the tangent lines go vertical at the endpoints.

So we now have the derivative of the arcsine function.
The derivative of the arccosine function is extremely similar.
So we're not going to do that.
And the arctangent function we're going to leave to you.
So enjoy.
