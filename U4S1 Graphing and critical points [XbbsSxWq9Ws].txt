At this point you can recognize properties
of a function's derivative and second derivative
by looking at its graph.
In this section we are doing the reverse.
Using information about the function and its derivatives,
we can sketch a graph that captures
all the salient features.
This sketch might not be to scale, but that is OK.
We just want to get the general idea of the function, thinking
of it as a curve, without getting
stuck on the actual values.
Warning.
Your common sense is going to be the main ingredient.
So don't forget your pre-calculus skills.
