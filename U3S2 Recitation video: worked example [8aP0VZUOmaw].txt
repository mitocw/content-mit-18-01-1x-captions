Hi.
Welcome back to recitation.
In lecture, you started learning about quadratic approximation.
So today we're just going to do a quick example of it.
So I have a question written here
on the board, what is the quadratic approximation
of the function f of x equals e to the x plus x squared?
So here, x then plus x squared is the exponent,
so it's e to the quantity x plus x squared near x equals 0.
So why don't you take a minute or two, pause the video,
work this out on your own, and then come back
and we can do it together.

All right, welcome back.
So there are two different ways we can do this problem.
Let's first just do it the totally straightforward way,
which is that you have this formula
for quadratic approximations in terms
of the derivatives of your function.
And so we can just apply that formula.
So here-- so the formula is that the quadratic approximation
of the function f--
so here near the point 0 is equal to f of 0 plus
f prime of 0 times x plus f double prime of 0 over 2 times
x squared.
So in order to use this formula, we just
need to know what the derivatives of our function
are and their values at 0.
So first we can do the first derivative f.
So for that, it's just a straightforward application
of the chain rule.
Our outer function is e to the x and our inner function
is x plus x squared.
So the derivative, then applying the chain rule,
is e to the x plus x squared times 1
plus 2x, which I can also write as e--
well, let me just re-order it.
2x plus 1 times e to the x plus x squared.
OK, so that's the first derivative.
And for the second derivative, I can apply just the product rule
here, right?
So I've got a--
the second derivative is the derivative
of the first derivative, so here I have a product.
So f double prime of x is equal to-- well,
so we take the derivative of the first one, which
is just 2 times the second, plus the derivative
of the second one.
Well, the second one is e to the x plus x squared.
It's actually f of x, so we already computed it once.
So the derivative of the second is 2x plus 1 e to the x
plus x squared times the first.
So times another 2x.
Plus 1-- OK, and if I multiply these two together and combine
all my terms, this is 4x squared plus 4x plus 3 times e to the x
plus x squared.
So these are the first and second derivatives.
And what I need to plug them into my formula
is I need their values at 0.
So I need the function value at 0.
So f of 0, well that's e to the 0 plus 0 squared.
And so it's e to the 0, so that's just 1.
f prime at 0--
let's see, I go over to my formula for f prime
and I plug-in x equals 0, so I have 2 times 0 plus 1.
So that's 1 times e to the 0.
So that's 1 times 1.
That's also 1.
And for f double prime, at 0 I go to my formula
for f double prime and I put in 0.
And so this is 0 and that's 0, so I have a 3 times 1.
So that's 3.
And now I just take these three values,
and I plug them right into my formula.
So the quadratic approximation is
q of f equals 1 plus x plus 3x squared over 2.
All right, great.
So that was one way to do this problem.
Another way to do this problem is the following.
And in this case, I'm not sure which way is simpler,
but in some cases one way is clearly easier than the other.
So if we illustrate both, then you'll
have twice as many tools to work with.
So the other way is to notice--
so the exponential function is nice when you have--
one of your exponential rules is that the exponential of a sum
is the product of the exponentials.
So we can rewrite f of x equals e to the x times
e to the x squared.
Now, this may seem a little bit silly to you,
but if you watched Christine's recitation
video you saw that to find the quadratic approximation
to a product, it's enough to find
the quadratic approximations to each piece
separately, multiply together, and then take
that quadratic approximation.
So in this case, the quadratic approximations
are things you might already know.
So in particular, we saw in recit- sorry,
in lecture that the quadratic approximation of e to the x
is 1 plus x plus x squared over 2.
And I'm going to tell you, if you haven't seen it
in recitation there are a bunch of different ways
you could work it out for yourself,
but the quadratic approximation for e to the x squared
is equal to 1 plus x squared.
So if you don't believe me, by all
means work that out for yourself to check it.
So in this case-- so that means that
the quadratic approximation of f is
equal to, by the rule Christine showed you,
it's the quadratic-- so it's equal
to the quadratic approximation of the product
of the quadratic approximations.
So that that's one plus x plus x squared over 2 times 1 plus
x squared.
Now, if you multiply these two out, that's not hard.
There are six terms, so this is the quadratic approximation
of 1 plus x plus x squared over 2.
So if you multiply 1 through here and now x squared.
So that's plus x squared plus x cubed plus, OK,
some fourth degree term, x to the fourth over 2.
And now the quadratic approximation to this we
get just by dropping the cubic and quartic terms.
OK, and we can add these two squared terms together.
So this is equal to 1 plus x plus 3x squared over 2.
And luckily, doing the same problem two different ways,
we get the same answer, which is, what should happen.
So that's that.
