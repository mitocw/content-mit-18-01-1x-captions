Functions that aren't one-to-one don't have full inverses.
But we can still get what we call a partial inverse.
We mentioned this briefly in the last video
in regards to the function f of x equals x squared.
This isn't one-to-one.
It doesn't satisfy the horizontal line test.
But if we ignore the left hand side-- let's just erase it--
and we only pay attention to the right half of the graph,
then it does satisfy the horizontal line test.
What we're doing here is only allowing
values of x that are greater than or equal to 0.
We've restricted our domain.
So now when we reflect across that y equals x line,
we get this.
It's not a full inverse-- just a partial inverse--
but it does satisfy the vertical line test.

For the original function, we restricted its inputs
to numbers which are greater than or equal to 0.
So for the partial inverse, its outputs
are restricted to numbers which are greater than or equal to 0.
So that's why when we write the square root of 4,
we don't just mean the number x whose square is 4.
That's not quite right, since there's
more than one such number.
Rather, we need to remember our restriction.
The square root of 4 is the number x
which is greater than or equal to 0 whose square is 4.
That's the difference between a full complete inverse
and a partial one.
A partial inverse has this additional condition,
and that's what ensures that we get a unique answer.

We'll use partial inverses most often for the trig functions.
Here's the graph of the cosine function.
And it's very much not one-to-one.
However, if we restrict our attention just
to this part of the curve where the angle, which
I'm going to call theta, is between 0 and pi,
then it does satisfy the horizontal line test.
Now it's true that we could have chosen a different interval
to restrict the domain to, but this is the standard choice
since it includes all the usual angles like pi over 6,
pi over 4, zero, et cetera.
And notice, even though we are ignoring all of the stuff
to the right and left-- let me just erase it--
we still have the entire range of the cosine function
from minus 1 to 1.
Ok?

So given this choice of restricted domain,
we get a partial inverse for the cosine function.
We're still going to denote it by cosine minus 1
x like this-- cosine inverse.
And remember that's not an exponent right there.
Or sometimes people use arccosine x instead.
But in any case, the inverse cosine
of x is the angle theta in the allowable interval-- so
in this case, in 0 to pi whose cosine is
x or such that cosine theta equals x.
And it's this restriction to the interval from 0 to pi
that let's us say the angle.

We'll leave the inverse sine function for an exercise,
but I do want to discuss the inverse tangent for a bit.
Here's the graph of the tangent function.
And again, to get a partial inverse,
we'll have to pick just one part of the function.
So if we take just this part, that'll work.
And we haven't given up any part of the range
of the tangent function, so that's good.
So this restricted domain is theta, our angle between pi
over 2 and minus pi over 2.
This is a strict inequality here,
since the tangent function is undefined at plus or minus pi
over 2.
And so tangent inverse of x or arctan
of x, that'll be the angle theta in the interval from minus
pi over 2 to pi over 2.
And here it's an open interval because we
don't need the endpoints such that tangent theta equals x.

So those are the inverse trig functions.
They actually pop up quite a bit in calculus,
even in places where you don't expect any trigonometry.
So it's good to get used to them now.
