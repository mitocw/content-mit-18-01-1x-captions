Logarithms are useful in modeling and measuring
real world phenomena, such as: sound, measured in decibels;
the intensity of earthquakes, measured using the Richter
scale; and the acidity of aqueous solutions,
measured in pH.
Not only that, but a lot of economic data,
such as currency fluctuations and stock prices,
are best measured using logarithms.
Since the logarithm is such an important function,
we are going to review its properties
and then compute its derivative.
