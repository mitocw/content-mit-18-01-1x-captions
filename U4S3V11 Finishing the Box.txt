OK.
Here is our set up.
We had x representing the size of the squares
that we're cutting out of the quarters here.
And if we do that, then the length of the resulting box
is this quantity.
It's 12 minus 2x.
And the width of the resulting box is 8 minus 2x.
The height is just x.
And so the volume written as a function
of x is 12 minus 2x times 8 minus 2x times x.

We also asked you to figure out the allowable interval for x.
And hopefully you figured out that x can't be below 0,
and it has to be less than or equal to 4.
Otherwise you get negative width,
and I don't think that really works for a box.

All right.
Well once you've done that, then we can
solve for the critical points.
And you should have found two critical points.
10 plus or minus 2 square root 7 over 3 but only one of those
is in the allowable interval.
So that's x equals 10 minus 2 root 7
over 3, which is approximately 1.57 feet.
And the other critical point gives you a nonsensical box.

All right.
And we also need to check the endpoints as usual.
So if you plug either at the endpoints in,
then you're going to get v equals 0.
That's something you may have anticipated
if you remember why the endpoints are what they are.
X equals 0 gives us a box with no height.
X equals 4 gives us a box that's infinitely skinny, no width.
But sometimes it's not so clear that the endpoints
are not what's going to be optimal, in which case
you definitely want to make sure to check them numerically.

Anyhow, this just leaves us with the one critical point
at 1.57 feet for x.
And if you plug that into v, and you probably want a calculator
here, you get 67.6 cubic feet.
So to summarize the strategy for optimization problems
that we just followed, we started by drawing a picture.
Next, we gave a name to the independent variable.
So in our case, we used x to represent the size of the cut
out squares because that was the quantity that we had control
over.
And then we wrote the quantity that we
wanted to optimize solely in terms of that variable.
So we wrote v as a function of x.

Then we determined the allowable interval
for the independent variable.
And last, is the calculus.
We want to check the critical points and the endpoints
either by plugging them in or by taking limits, depending.
And that's all there is to it.
We have some problems.
So you can try it on your own.
