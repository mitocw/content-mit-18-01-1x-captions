There are three main interpretations
of the derivative.
First, the physical interpretation
as an instantaneous rate of change.
Second, the geometric interpretation
as the slope of the tangent line.
And third, the interpretation is the sensitivity
of a function to small changes.
Which is important in analyzing experimental data.
Last time, we talked about the physical interpretation.
Now we'll explore the geometric viewpoint.
Later on, we will connect these ideas
to sensitivity of measurements.
You may find one of these perspectives
more intuitive than the others.
But our goal is to get you comfortable with all of them.
And able to move fluently between them.
