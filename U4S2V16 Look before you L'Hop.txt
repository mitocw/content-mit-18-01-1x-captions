Now, let me give you one more example.

Suppose you're trying to understand the limit of sin x
over x squared.

If you apply L'Hopital's rule, as x goes to 0,
you're going to get cosine x over 2x.
And if you apply L'Hopital's rule again, as x goes to 0,
you're going to get minus sin x over 2.
And this-- as x goes to zero-- goes to zero.

Right?

On the other hand, if you look at the linear approximation
method, the linear approximation says that sin x
is approximately x near zero.

So that should be x over x squared,
which is 1 over x, which goes to infinity
as x goes to 0, at least from one side,
minus infinity to the other side.

So there's something fishy going on here.
This is fishy.
Or maybe this is fishy.
I don't know.
So tell me what's wrong here.
Yeah?
Your second L'Hopital wasn't applied correctly
because cosine x over 2x isn't indeterminate as x approaches 0
because cosine x is just one.
OK.
All right.
So the claim is that the second application of L'Hopital's
rule-- this one-- is wrong.

OK?
And that's correct.
And this is where you have to watch out
with L'Hopital's rule.
This is exactly where you have to watch out.
You have to apply the test.
Here, it's an indeterminate form.
It's 0/0 before I applied the rule.
But in order to apply the rule the second time,
it still has to be 0/0, but this one isn't.
This one is 1/0.

All right?
It's no longer an indeterminate form.
It's actually infinite-- either plus or minus,
depending on the sign of the denominator, which
is just what this answer is.
So the linear approximation is safe.
And we just applied L'Hopital's rule wrong.
All right?
So the moral of the story here is look before you L'Hop.
