I want to remind you about the logarithm functions.
Recall that log base a of y is defined to be the number
x, such that a to the x is equal to y.
In other words, log base a of y is
the inverse of the exponential function a to the x.
And recall that we called a the base
of the exponential function a to the x.
So similarly, we call this function log base a.
In particular, there are some common bases
that we are used to thinking about.
Log base 2 of x is the inverse of 2 to the x.
Log base 10 of x is the inverse of 10 to the x.
And in fact, we are so used to thinking about numbers
in base 10, that oftentimes you might
see log base 10 of x written as just log x with no base.
But be careful because there are certain programming languages
where this is not true.
But on most calculators this is the notation.
And it means base 10.
The other base that is going to be extremely important to us--
and it's actually the one that we are interested in right
now-- is log base e.
And this is so important, we are actually
going to give it another name and another notation.
So let's go ahead and make a definition.
The natural logarithm, which we denote by ln of x,
is the inverse of the exponential function
e to the x.
And this function, log x, is actually
going to play a pretty major role
in helping us finish computing the rest of the derivatives
of functions we haven't been able to compute yet.
Let's go ahead and graph the natural logarithm.
To do this, we're going to use the fact
that we know the graph of the exponential function
e to the x.
Remember that the graph of e to the x looks like this.
It is concave up and goes through the point 0,1.
To find the graph of log x, we're
simply going to reflect this graph across the line y
equals x.
And we get that the graph of log x goes through the point 1,0
and looks like so.
Notice that both log x and e to the x are growing to infinity.
But log x grows much more slowly than e to the x
because this graph is actually going to be concave down.
But it's still approaching infinity.
And the other thing that I want to point out
is that the slope of the tangent line
to e to the x through the point 0,1 this has slope equal to 1.
That's actually how we define the number e.
And this tells us that the tangent line
to log x through the point 1,0 is also going to have slope 1.

Before we get any further into finding
the derivative of this function, I
want to remind you of some of the properties
of the natural logarithm.
And these properties actually hold for all logarithms
with any base.
And all of these properties follow
from the inverse relationship with the exponential functions.
These properties are that log a1 times
a2 is equal to log of a1 plus log of a2.
And this follows from the property
that e to the b1 times e to the b2
is equal to e to the b1 plus b2.
The other important property is that log of a to the n
is equal to n times log a.
And this follows from the property
that e to the b all to the power n
is equal to e to the b times n.
I'm going to leave it to you to verify
why these properties hold.
Before we do calculus with the natural logarithm,
I want you to do some exercises to re-familiarize yourself
with the log and its behavior.
