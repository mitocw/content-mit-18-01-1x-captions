OK we've got an oil spill and it's growing.
Let me start by drawing a picture.
We said we're treating the oil as a cylinder.
So there it is.
And now there's going to be a lot of variables here.
So we're going to need to keep very good track of our data.
What do we know and what do we want?
One thing that we're given is this figure
of two million liters per hour.
That's a rate, it's a derivative.
And to denote it we're really going
to want to use Leibniz's notation because we
need to know that it's a rate of what with respect to what.
In this case, it's the rate of change
of volume with respect to time.
So we'll write dv dt.
And we're being asked for a different rate.
We want the speed at which the edge is moving out.
The center point is fixed, so the speed of the edge
is just the rate of growth of the radius,
again with respect to time.
In other words, dr dt.

This is an example of what's called a related rates problem.
We're given one rate of change and we're
asked to find a related rate of change.
dv dt and dr dt are related because V and r
and are related.
V is always equal to pi h r squared.
We also have that h equals two centimeters
and we're modeling that as a constant.
So we can plug that value in whenever we want.
And also we want this dr dt when r is 250 meters.
But here we have to be careful, r is not a constant,
it changes as time elapses.
So r is really a function of t.
And that means we should only plug-in for r after we're
done taking derivatives.
If you plug-in before then you're
not allowing r to change anymore and taking a rate of change
of r wouldn't make any sense.

OK back to the equation.
In order to get information about rates
we're going to differentiate this.
With respect to what variable?
Well, both the rate that we want and the rate that we know,
r with respect to time, so we'll differentiate with respect
to t.
d dt on the left d dt on the right.
There aren't any t's in the equation,
but we're treating v as a function of t and r
as a function of t and differentiating implicitly.
It's perfectly legal since this equation is true at all times.
What you should do now is take a moment
and remember how implicit differentiation works.
I'll talk to you in a little bit.
