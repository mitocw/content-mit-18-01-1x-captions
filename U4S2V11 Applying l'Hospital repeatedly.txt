I'm going to give you another example which
shows that it works a little better than the method
that I started out with.

Here's what happens if we consider the function, (cosine)
x minus 1 divided by x squared.
All right?
Now that was a little harder to deal with.
And again, this is one of these 0 over 0 things
near x equals 0.
As x tends to zero, this goes to an indeterminate form here.
Now according to our method, this is equivalent to-- now
I'm going to use this little wiggle
because I don't want to write limit limit
limit limit a million times.
So I'm going to use a little wiggle here.
So as x goes to 0, this is going to behave the same way
as differentiating numerator and denominator.
So again, this is going to be minus (sine(x))
in the numerator.
And the denominator, it's going to be 2x.

Now notice that we've still haven't won yet because this
is still a 0 over 0 type.
When you plug in x equals zero, you still get zero.
But that doesn't damage the method.
That doesn't make the method fail.
This is 0 over 0.
We can apply L'Hopital's rule a second time.
OK?

And as x goes to 0, this is the same thing as-- again,
differentiating the numerator and denominator.
So here, I get minus (cosine(x)) in the numerator,
and I get 2 in the denominator.
Again, this is way easier than differentiating
ratios of functions.
We're only differentiating the numerator and the denominator
separately.

And now this is the end.
As x goes to 0, this is minus (cosine) of 0 divided by 2,
which is minus 1/2.
And that's the-- All right?
Now, the justification for this comes only
when you win in the end and get the limit.
Because what the theorem says is, that if one of these limits
exist, then the preceding one exists.
And once the proceeding one exists, then the one
before it exists.
So once we know that this one exists, that works backwards.
It applies to the preceding limit, which then
applies to the very first one.
And the logical structure here is a little subtle,
which is that if the right side exist,
then the left side will also exists.
