In this video, we're going to talk about combinations
of trig and inverse trig functions.
So here's what I mean.
Let's take arccosine of 8/9.
This is supposed to give us the angle between 0 and pi
whose cosine is 8/9.
So in particular, this arccosine is an angle.
And so it would make a lot of sense
to take, say, the tangent of it.
That would be highly meaningful.
In contrast, we don't normally think
of the output of, say, a sine function as being an angle.
And so it's less natural to think about the tangent
of a sine of some x.
So let's not discuss that.
Let's stick to the tangent of an arccosine.
That does make sense.
Anyways, this arccosine of 8/9-- it's some angle theta.
And I don't know what this theta is numerically,
but I can draw theta.
Theta is supposed to be the angle between 0 and pi
that has a cosine of 8/9.
And the cosine is supposed to be the adjacent leg
over the hypotenuse.
And so if we just take a right triangle
where this leg is eight and the hypotenuse is nine,
then this right here is an angle whose cosine is 8/9.
And it's between 0 and pi, so we're all good.
That's our theta.
And we want the tangent of theta.
So that's going to be the opposite leg
over the adjacent leg.
And so we need the length of this opposite leg.
And we can just use the Pythagorean theorem.
So 9 squared minus 8 squared is 17.
So this leg should be the square root of 17.
And then we get that the tangent of theta
is the opposite-- so square root of 17 over the adjacent, which
is eight.
And we're done.
This is going to be really, really useful when
we start talking about the derivatives
of these inverse trig functions, which will be right after you
get a little bit of practice.
See you soon.
