So maybe we'll call this Example 4.

This is supposedly a real-life example.
I'll try to persuade you that it is.

So I like this example because it's got a lot of math
as well as physics in it.
So here I am on the surface of the Earth.
And here is a satellite going this way
at some velocity v. OK?
And the satellite has a clock on it,
because this is a GPS satellite.
And it has a time T, OK?
But I have a watch.
In fact, it's right here.
And I have a time which I keep, which is T prime.
And there's an interesting relationship
between T and T prime, which is called time dilation.

And this is from special relativity.

And it's the following formula-- T prime is
equal to T divided by the square root of 1
minus v squared over c squared, where
v is the velocity of the satellite
and c is the speed of light.

OK?
So now, I'd like to get a rough idea of how different
my watch is from the clock on the satellite.
All right?
So I'm going to use this same approximation.
We've already used it once.
I'm going to write T-- but now, let me just remind you.
The situation here is we have something of the form 1 minus u
to the minus 1/2.
All right?
That's what's happening when I multiply through here.
So with u equal to v squared over c squared.
All right?
So in real life, of course, the expression
we're going to use the linear approximation on
isn't necessarily itself linear.
It can be any physical quantity.
So in this case, it's v squared over c squared.
And now, the approximation formula
says that this is approximately equal to-- well, again,
it's the same rule.
There's an r.
And then x is minus u.
So this is minus minus 1/2.
So it's 1 plus 1/2 u.
All right?

So this is approximately, by the same rule,
this is T. T prime is approximately T times 1
plus 1/2 v squared over c squared.

Now, I promised you that this would be a real-life problem.
So the question is, when people were designing these GPS
systems, they run clocks in the satellites.
You're down there.
You're making your measurements.
You're talking to the satellite, or you're receiving its signals
from its radio.
The question is, is this going to cause problems
in the transmission?

And there are dozens of such problems you have to check for.
So in this case, what actually happens
is that v is about four kilometers per second.
That's how fast the GPS satellites actually go.
In fact, they had to decide to put them at a certain altitude.
And they could have tweaked this if they'd
put them at different places.
Anyway, the speed of light is 3 times
10 to the fifth kilometers per second.
All right?
So this number-- v squared over c squared-- is approximately 10
to the minus 10.
All right?
Now, if you actually keep track of how much of an error
that would make in a GPS location, what you would find
is maybe it's a millimeter, or something like that.
So, in fact, it doesn't matter.
So that's nice.
But in fact, the engineers who were
designing these systems actually did use this very computation.
Exactly this.
And the way that they used it was they
decided that because the clocks were different,
when the satellite broadcast its radio frequency, that frequency
would be shifted, would be offset.
And they decided that the fidelity was so important
that they would send the satellites off
with exactly this offset to compensate
for the way the signal is.
So from the point of view of good reception
on your little GPS device, they change the frequency
at which the transmitter in the satellites
according to exactly this rule.

And incidentally, the reason why they
ignored higher-order terms, the quadratic terms,
is that if you take u squared, that's of size 10
to the minus 20.
And that really is totally negligible.
That doesn't matter to any measurement at all.
That's on the order of nanometers.
And it's not important for any of the uses to which GPS
is put.
OK.
So that's a real example of a use of linear approximations.
