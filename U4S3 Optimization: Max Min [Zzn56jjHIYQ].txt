We're going to use the geometry and physics of zip lines,
like this one, to illustrate some basic calculus methods.
It turns out that predicting how a zip line will behave
is complicated by many factors, like wind and friction.
But with the tools we have now, we can get started.
We'll get deeper into designing a good zip
line in later courses.
The first important issue in figuring out
what happens during a zip line ride
is to figure out the total vertical drop of the rider--
what is it and how can we find it?
If we assume the cable is massless,
then the cable does not sag, and the path traversed by the rider
is the arc of an ellipse.

The vertical drop traversed by the rider
is this distance here.
Finding this distance is equivalent to finding
the minimum y-coordinate along the path.
We're going to use calculus to find maxima and minima,
and solve optimization problems.
And then we'll solve this problem.
