You already know how to find linear approximations
of functions, so that's where we're going to start.
And we want to give you a taste of how linear approximations
are used in the real world.
To illustrate this, I'm going to work through an example
involving zip line design.
As a zip line designer, I care about how fast
a rider will travel.
And a zip line rider's velocity is
going to depend on the mass of the rider.
And it's also going to be affected
by wind and other weather-related phenomena.
But as a designer, I can't control the rider's mass.
And I can't control the weather.
But given a fixed horizontal span between two trees, what
I can control is the total vertical height traversed
throughout the zip line ride.
So let's formulate a problem.
Let h be the total height traversed by a rider.
And let v be the maximum velocity
achieved during the ride.
What I want to know is how changes in the vertical height
will change the maximum velocity experienced by the rider.
That is, I'm asking for a relationship between delta v
and delta h.

To get started, we need to understand
the maximum velocity.
A good first approach is to use conservation of energy.
Let E denote the total energy in the system.
So what is E?
Well, E is whatever energy I start with,
which is the total potential energy, which is mgh.
Here, m is the mass of the rider,
g is the gravitational constant, and h
is the total vertical height traversed during the zip line
ride.
Of course, this isn't the only energy in the system.
We need to add to this the kinetic energy
that the rider starts off with.
And I know that when I go down a zip line ride,
I usually give myself a small push off the platform.
So the rider's probably going to start with some small amount
of kinetic energy.
But I don't need to worry too much
about what this is, because this is just all wrapped up
into this total energy term E.
And the key thing here is that E is a constant,
because energy is conserved.
So whatever energy I start with, this is a fixed constant.
This is the total energy in my system at any given time.

Then, the maximum possible velocity
that the rider can experience is when
all of this energy in the system is
converted into kinetic energy.
Now, we know that this is not very realistic,
because some of this energy is going
to be converted into heat due to friction or wind resistance.
But we aren't going to worry about this.
We're going to ignore these effects for now,
and focus on this idealized system where all of this energy
is transferred into kinetic energy
to find the maximum possible velocity.
The expression for kinetic energy is 1/2 mv squared.
So the maximum velocity happens when
E is equal to 1/2 mv squared.
So I'm going to leave it to you to find the expression for v
in terms of E, just by doing some algebra.
And then, you are going to find a linear approximation
that we are going to use in figuring out
the relationship between delta v and delta h.
Good luck.
