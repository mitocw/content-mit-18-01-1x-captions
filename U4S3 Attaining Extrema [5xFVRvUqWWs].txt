In this section, we're going to discuss
finding a function's maximum and minimum values on an interval.
You might be wondering, wait a minute,
I thought we already learned about local maxima and minima.
And that's true, but I said maximum and minimum
on an interval.
Not local maximum or local minimum.
What's the difference?

Well, let's look at this function.
Here I've drawn it on the interval I, which is the closed
interval from 1 to 4.
We're going to be focusing on closed
intervals for the first few parts of this section.
And you can see that there are two local maxima,
here and here.
But only one of them is the maximum
of f over the entire interval I from 1 to 4,
and that's this one.

Formally, we're going to say that f attains its maximum
on the interval I at a point x equals c If f of c
is greater than or equal to f of x for all x in I.
There's a similar definition for attaining
a minimum on an interval, but I'm not
going to write that down.
The difference between this and the notion of a local maximum,
is that here the interval is predetermined.
f of c has to be the biggest value
of f on the entire interval I. Whereas to have a local maximum
at c merely requires f of c to be
the largest on some interval around c, possibly really
small.

So here we can say that f attains its maximum value on I
at x equals 2.
And since f of 2 equals 3, we'll also
say that the maximum value that f attains on I is 3.

What about our minimum?
And there is a local minimum here,
but it's not the minimum value of f over the entire interval,
since f gets smaller over here.
In fact, the minimum value is attained here
at x equals 4, the endpoint.
And the minimum value attained by f on I
is f of 4, which equals 1.

Interestingly, if f continues past x equals 4 like this,
then x equals 4 would not be a local minimum for f.
But it is where f attains its minimum on the closed
interval from 1 to 4.

I'll erase this.
And let's look at another function.
Here you might be tempted to say that f attains its maximum on I
right here at x equals 2.
But that can't be correct.
f of 2 is down here at the solid circle.
And there are lots of other values of f that are bigger.
So where does f attain its maximum?
x equals 1.9?
Well, no.
Because if you move just a little bit to the right,
say to x equals 1.95, then f gets a little bit bigger.
But f doesn't attain its maximum at x equals 1.95 either.
We can find values of f that get arbitrarily close to 3,
but f never attains that value.
And so the answer is that f does not attain its maximum
on this interval at any point.

How about its minimum?
Well, f of 3 equals 1 and f of 4 also equals 1.
And there's no smaller value of f on this interval.
So we say that f attains its minimum value of 1
on this interval at x equals 3 and at x equals 4.
It's OK if they're tied.
So functions might attain their maximum or minimum
on an interval at multiple points, or at no points.
We'll let you play around with a few more examples.
