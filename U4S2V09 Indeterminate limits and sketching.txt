We've told you what L'Hopital's rule is,
but now it's time to see how to actually use it in practice.
And the example that I want to give you
is an example that we're looking at in this section.
Which is that I want to sketch the function x minus 1 divided
by log x.
Our general approach suggests that I
should look at points where the function might be discontinuous
as well as at the endpoints.
The far left endpoint is x equals 0.
The far right endpoint is positive infinity.
And there might be something interesting happening
when x is equal to 1.
Because when x is equal to 1, the denominator is 0.
But the numerator is also 0.
So this is an indeterminate form of type 0 over 0.
So let's look and see what happens
as x approaches 1 of our function, x minus 1 over log x.

Applying L'Hopital's rule, we know
that this limit is equal to the limit
as x approaches 1 of the derivative of the top, which
is equal to 1 divided by the derivative of the bottom, which
is equal to 1 over x.

Simplifying, this is the limit as x
approaches 1 of x, which is of course equal to 1.
So in fact, nothing crazy happens to our function at 1.
And this is actually a removable discontinuity.
Next, let's look at the endpoints.
So we want to evaluate what happens
as x tends towards infinity.
At infinity this is an indeterminate form
of type infinity over infinity.
So this is the candidate to apply L'Hopital's rule version
two.
So this limit is going to be equal to the limit
as x approaches infinity of the derivative of the numerator
over the derivative of the denominator, which of course
we just computed.
And we saw that it simplifies to x.
So it's just this limit, and the limit
as x tends to infinity of x is infinity.
So what this means is that in the race
to infinity of x minus 1 over log x,
the x minus 1-- well, really the dominant term-- the x
is winning.
We can interpret this as saying that the numerator x minus 1
grows to infinity faster than the denominator log x grows
to infinity as x becomes large.
You'll do some problems later on that
have to do with the growth rates of functions.
But for now, let's continue and look
at the behavior of our function at the left endpoint.
That is, we need to compute the limit
as x tends to 0 from the right of x minus 1 over log x.
We get negative 1 over negative infinity, which tends to 0.

Do not use L'Hopital's rule here.
You must verify that a limit is of indeterminate form 0 over 0
or infinity over infinity before you try to use the rule.

Of course, remember that our goal in doing these examples
was to sketch this function.
So let's erase L'Hopital's rule to make room for a graph.
I'm going to leave it to you to verify
that this is the shape of the graph by looking
at the first and second derivatives.
So far, all we really know is that the function is 0 as 0,
that there is a removable discontinuity at x
equals 1 that is equal to 1, and that the function
tends towards infinity as x gets large.

It's now your turn to get some practice using
L'Hopital's rule.
Good luck.
