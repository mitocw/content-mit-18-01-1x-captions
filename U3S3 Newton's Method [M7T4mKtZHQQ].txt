We've looked at linear approximation,
and we've also seen that quadratic approximation can
get even closer estimates.
Both linear and quadratic approximations
are very important to calculus and all its applications.
But neither of them is useful if the point where we calculate
the approximation is not close enough to the point we
want to estimate.
In this section, we're going to look
and an extraordinarily powerful algorithm for solving equations
known as Newton's Method.
Newton's Method amplifies the effectiveness
of the linear approximation by using it
at many points which get successively closer and closer
to the desired solution.
We'll see, for example, that's Newton's method
to solves the equation x squared equals 5 accurately two one
billionth in only five steps.
