I just got a speeding ticket in the mail.
There were no police present on the turnpike,
so my question for you is, how did they know I was speeding?
What I can tell you is that I went
through the toll booth at the 50 mile marker at eight AM.
I went through a second toll booth at the 220 mile marker
at ten AM.
And by the way, I was certainly going slower than the speed
limit through the toll booths.
In this lesson, you'll figure out
why I got this speeding ticket.
We'll learn about average velocity,
instantaneous velocity, and explore
the relationship between them.
This relationship is crucial to the definition
of the derivative; and the derivative
is the subject of this entire course.
