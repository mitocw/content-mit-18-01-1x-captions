I want to show you how we can use big O notation
to keep track of error terms.
In order for this to be a useful notation,
we're going to need to develop a bit of an algebra of using
big O notation.
And to develop this algebra, we have
to keep in mind what does big O of x, or in the case
that we're going to be interested in,
what does big O of x cubed really mean.
Well, a function is big O of x cubed
if it's dominant behavior near x equal 0 looks like x cubed.
Let's go ahead and see how this plays out with some examples.
And the example that I'm going to look at is e to the sine x.
This is basically a function you will never
encounter in the real world, but it is a function.
This is equal to e get to the x plus big O of x cubed.
This is the quadratic approximation of sine x,
even though there's no quadratic term,
and note that I am using an equal sign here
instead of an approximately equal sign, because I'm keeping
track of this error term.
This is an equality.
So now I'm going to go ahead and make a substitution.
I'm going to call x plus big O of x cubed u.
So then this is e to the u.
And I can find the quadratic approximation of this function.
This is 1 plus u plus u squared over 2 plus big O of u cubed.
And then I can just go ahead and plug-in x plus big O
of x cubed n for u.
That gives me 1 plus x plus big O
of x cubed plus the quantity x plus big O of x cubed
squared all over 2 plus big O of the quantity
x plus big O of x cubed, cubed.

The first thing to keep in mind is
that this term here, this big O of x plus big O of x cubed,
the dominant term here is still going to be x cubed.
So this is big O of x cubed, because all of these higher
order terms in here are negligible in comparison
to the x cubed.
Now let's do it the other terms.
If I square this, I'm going to get
x squared over 2 plus a bunch of higher order terms.
All of that just gets absorbed into this big O of x cubed.

Similarly, this error term all just
gets absorbed into this big O of x cubed.
So what I'm left with is 1 plus x plus x squared
over 2 plus big O x cubed.
And that's the quadratic approximation.

Let's look at another example.
The example we're going to look at
is the same example we looked at with linear approximation.
We're going to do a product.
And I want to look at e to the negative 3 x divided
by the square root of 1 plus x.
To find the approximation of the product,
I'm going to take the product of the approximations.
So let's find the quadratic approximations of each term.
e to the negative 3 x, this is 1 minus 3 x
plus 9 x squared over 2 plus, well,
I could write this as big O of negative 3 x cubed,
but this constant term isn't going
to change the dominant behavior.
So I'm just going to get rid of that
and write this as big O of x cubed.
Then I know 1 plus x to the negative 1/2, that
is given by 1 minus x over 2 plus 3/8 x
squared plus big O of x cubed.
So to find the approximation, I'm
just going to do some algebra, and I'm
going to multiply this out.

And any time I get a term that is x cubed or higher, I'm just
throwing that into this error term, which I know
is big O of x cubed.
So let's go ahead and do that algebra.
I'm going to speed it up a little bit,
but you can pause this and do the algebra out on your own
if you are interested.
And we get 1 minus 7/2 x plus 51/8 x
squared plus big O of x cubed.

I hoped that you find this notation useful.
So I'm going to give you an opportunity
now to get some practice using it
in finding quadratic approximations of some more
complicated functions.
