OK, so I told you about this first method.
Now I want to tell you about a second method here.

So the second method is called logarithmic differentiation.

Logarithmic differentiation.

All right, so how does this work?
Well sometimes you're having trouble
differentiating a function, and it's easier
to differentiate its logarithm.

That may seem peculiar, but actually we'll
give several examples where this is clearly the case,
that the logarithm is easier to differentiate
than the function.
So it could be that this is an easier quantity to understand.
So we want to relate it back to the function, u.
So I'm going to write it a slightly different way.
So let's write it in terms of primes, here.
So the basic identity is the chain rule, again.
And the derivative of the logarithm-- well,
maybe I'll write it out this way first.
So this would be d of log u du, times d by dx of u.
OK, these are the two factors.

And that's the same thing.
So remember what the derivative of the logarithm is.
This is-- what is it?
1 over u.
So here I have a 1 over u, and here I have a du over dx.
So I'm going to encode this on the next board here,
which is sort of the main formula
that you always need to remember,
which is that log u prime is equal to u prime over u.
OK, that's the one to remember here.
Couldn't you get d l and u over du times du, over dx?
The question is, how did I get this step here, all right?
So this is the chain rule.

The rate of change of u, log u with respect to x
is the rate of change of log u with respect to u,
times the rate of change of u with respect to x.
That's the chain rule.

So now I've worked out this identity here.
And now let's show how it handles
this case, d by dx, a to the x.
Let's do this one.
So in order to get that one, I would
take u is equal to a to the x.

And now let's just take a look at what log u is.
Log u is equal to x log a.

Now I claim that this is pretty easy to differentiate.
Again, it may seem hard, but it's actually quite easy.
So maybe somebody can hazard a guess.
What's the derivative of x log a?

x log a?
It's just log a, right.
So this is that same thing that I
was talking about before, which is if you've got 3x,
and you're taking its derivative with respect to x here,
that's just three.
That's the kind of thing you have here.
Again, don't be put off by this massive piece of junk here.
It's a constant.
So again, keep that in mind.
It comes up regularly in this kind of question.
All right, so there's our formula that
is the derivative of the logarithmic derivative is this,
but let's just rewrite that, right?
That's the same thing as u prime over u,
which is log u prime is equal to log a, right?
So this is our differentiation formula.
So here we have u prime. u prime is equal to u times log a.
If I just multiply through by u, and that's what we wanted.
That's d by dx of a to the x is equal to log a.
I'll reverse the order of the two--
which is customary-- times a to the x.

All right?
So this is the way that logarithmic differentiation
works.
It's the same arithmetic as the previous method,
but we don't have to convert to base e.
We're just keeping track of the exponents,
and doing the differentiation on the exponents,
and multiplying through at the end.

OK, so so now I'm going to do two trickier examples which
illustrate logarithmic differentiation.

Again, these could be done equally well by using base e,
but I won't do it.
Method one and method two always both work.
So here's a second example.
Again, this is the problem when you have moving exponents,
But this time we're going to complicate matters
by having both a moving exponent, and a moving base.
All right?
So we have a function, u, which is-- well, maybe
I'll call it v, since we already had a function u-- which
is x to the x.
A really complicated looking function, here.
So again, you can handle this by converting
to base e, method one.
But we'll do the logarithmic differentiation version,
all right?
So I take the logs of both sides.

And now I differentiate it.

And now when I differentiate this,
here I have to use the product rule.
This time instead of having log a a constant,
I have a variable here.
So I have two factors.
I have log x, when I differentiate
with respect to x, and we differentiate with respect
to this factor here.
I get x times the derivative of that, which is 1 over x.

So here's my formula, almost finished.
So I have here v prime over v is equal to-- now
I'm going to multiply these two things together.
I'll put it on the other side, because I
don't want to get it mixed up with log
x plus 1, the quantity.

And now I'm almost done.
I have v prime is equal to v times 1 plus log x.
And that's just d by dx, x to the x
is equal to x to the x, times 1 plus log x.
All right, That's it.
