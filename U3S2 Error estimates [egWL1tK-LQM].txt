I'm sure you've noticed that we keep
using this squiggly equal sign to indicate
an approximate equality.
And what I want to answer now is, what does approximately
equal to really mean?
Here I have an example function, 1 plus x to the fifth,
that I'm considering for values of x near 0.
This function is approximately equal to 1 plus 5x.
That's the linear approximation.
It is also approximately equal to 1 plus 5x plus 10x squared.
That's the quadratic approximation.
So what does approximately equal mean?
What this really means is that this function
is exactly equal to 1 plus 5x plus some error function.
Similarly, in the quadratic case,
this function is exactly equal to 1 plus 5x plus 10x squared
plus some other error function.
These two error functions are not the same.
What I want to do is get a handle
on the order of magnitude of this error function.
The size of this error term quantifies how accurate
these approximations are.
Typically, the quadratic approximation
is more accurate than the linear approximation,
but we need a way to quantify exactly what that means.
So for now we're going to restrict our attention
to the linear approximation and its error time.
What we're going to see is that the absolute value
of this error function is actually
less than or equal to 12x squared for x near 0.
Let's explore this.
I chose this example to be completely transparent,
because I can expand this polynomial by hand
and I know exactly what this function is equal to.
1 plus x to the fifth is equal to 1
plus 5x plus 10x squared plus 10x cubed plus 5x
to the fourth plus x to the fifth.
In the linear approximation, the error function
is just what we get when we subtract off
the linear approximation from our function.
So the error function is this piece.
It's 10x squared plus 10x cubed plus 5x to the fourth plus
x to the fifth.
What we need to keep in mind is that when x is very close to 0,
even though these terms x to the fourth and x to the fifth
might seem big, because we're looking
at very small values of x, these higher powers
mean smaller not bigger.
For example, if we consider 1.1 to the fifth, here x is 1/10,
x squared is 1/100 x cubed is 1/1000,
x to the fourth is 1/10,000, and x to the fifth is 1/100,000.
If I'm looking at 1.01 to the fifth, then x is one 1/100,
x squared is already 1/10,000, and an x cubed is
1/100,000,000.
So these higher powers are more negligible,
the closer we are to 0.
And the only term that has much of an effect
is this leading term, this is the dominant term
of the error function.
So let's take a closer look at the size of our error function
when the absolute value of x is less than 1/10.
So here we know that the dominant term is 10x squared
and the next term is 10 times x cubed,
which is going to be bounded by 10 times 1/1,000,
which is just 1/100.
So these two terms together are bounded by 11x squared
and these higher order terms are very small.
So to be safe we'll bound them by x squared
and we get the entire function is bounded by 12x squared.
So now we have to introduce notation, big O notation.
And when I say is that this error function is big O of x
squared near x equals o.
The big O stands for order of magnitude.
And what we mean is that the dominant term is x squared
and all the higher order terms are negligible in comparison.
So let's give a formal definition.
We say that a function f of x is big O of x squared
near x equals 0 if the absolute value of f of x
is less than k times x squared for some constant k
when x is near 0.
The value of k is determined by the actual function.
What's the big deal?
Well, it turns out that for any function
that error the linear approximation
is big 0 of x squared.
So we write that like this.
We say f of x is f of 0 plus f prime of 0 times x
plus big 0 of x squared.
And it turns out that the error term
of the quadratic approximation is big O of x cubed.
As we mentioned before, this means that there's
some constant k, such that the error is bounded by k times
x squared or k times x cubed.
So you're going to get an opportunity
to explore this and get used to thinking
about the order of magnitude of these error functions.
